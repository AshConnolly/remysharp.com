# Ethical Web Principles

I've had this link open in my browser nearly a month after seeing [Jeremy](https://adactio.com) posting it. This list makes up the core ethics for working on the web. It's something I feel is worthy of re-reading every week to strengthen the message in my head.

*   There is one web
    
*   The web should not cause harm to society
    
*   The web must support healthy community and debate
    
*   The web is for all people
    
*   Security and privacy are essential
    
*   The web must enable freedom of expression
    
*   The web must make it possible for people to verify the information they see
    
*   The web must enhance individuals' control and power
    
*   The web must be an environmentally sustainable platform
    
*   The web is transparent
    
*   The web is multi-browser, multi-OS and multi-device
    
*   People should be able to render web content as they want
    

Apply these ethics and you'll build a solid and strong web, **for everyone**.
