# Browserling

Great lower priced alternative to a tool like browserstack. I've paid for this service for a few years and it does exactly what I need: provides a lot of older OS and browsers, spins them up quickly and provides a screenshot service.

Word of warning: it looks like it's not been updated in a few years. But it's definitely working.
