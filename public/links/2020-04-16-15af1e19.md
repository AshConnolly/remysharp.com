# BEM Naming Cheat Sheet

Good lord I've needed this. I've never gotten around to learning BEM and more and more of my clients use it, and I tend to just jump in and try to follow the patterns.

> A visual tool that provides naming-suggestions for CSS classes using BEM naming convention.

9elements have got a nice big cheatsheet with full HTML samples and common patterns to make my life a lot easier!.
