# If we stand still, we go backwards - JakeArchibald.com

Recently, ppk claimed the web is going too fast in the wrong direction, and asked for a year's moratorium on web features. I was so angry I ran straight to a dictionary to find out what "moratorium" meant. Turns out it means "suspension".

I got a bit snarky about it on Twitter, which isn't really fair, so here's a more considered response.
