# Parsing HTML at the command line

At first this looks like it's just selectors in on the command line to scrape HTML (though itself is useful), but where it gets interesting is the display options allowing me to display as text, select attributes or even spit out as JSON.

A nice compliment to a tool like [jq](https://jqterm.com)
