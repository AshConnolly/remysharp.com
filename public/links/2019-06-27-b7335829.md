# Developing a Robust Font Loading Strategy for CSS-Tricks

Superb dive into detail on how to analyse a font's contributing to bandwidth and performance, how to pick apart the font(s) to understand what's actually included, then _how_ to split the font up for staged loading for the best rendering performance.

Useful tools and practical (copy & paste) examples in the post too.
