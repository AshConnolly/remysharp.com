# Google open sources standardized code in bid to become Mr Robots.txt

The source code for Google's robots.txt parser has been released to encourage developers to standardise. Apparently the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) has never been standardised and we developers are proving our inability to spell properly!

> For example, it includes code to accept five different misspellings of the "disallow" directive in robots.txt.
