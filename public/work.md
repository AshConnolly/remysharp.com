My name is Remy Sharp, I'm a web developer from Brighton in the UK working commercially on the web since 1999.

### You may know me from:

### Type of work I can help you with

I've been working professionally on the web since 1999 and have a great deal of experience through experimentation, developing and deploying.

Primarily my skills are JavaScript, both client side and backend (via node), but I'm also highly competent with CSS and HTML, application architecture, performance, and the odd sysops here and there.

I'm open to anything interesting and challenging in front-end, node.js, or mobile web.

I also run training for your developers, again focused around JavaScript. Details of available workshops can be found on my business web site: [Left Logic](http://leftlogic.com/training).

### Rate and availability

My next availability is: Jan 12, 2016

My working week is Tuesday to Friday, and for full time dev projects. I bill hourly for projects with vague requirements and try to do fixed price for projects that have very clearly defined scopes.

I work remotely, and am happy to visit for face-to-face meetings.
