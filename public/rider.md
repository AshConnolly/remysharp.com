# Speaker Rider

<small>Closely based on [Stephanie Hurlburt's tweet-form rider](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/899400986791354368)</small>

If you're interested in having me speak at your conference I've included a number of ways you can contact me in at the end of this page.

I'm very honoured you've decided to invite me to your event and I want all conferences and events to be welcoming to all. So with that in mind, this is my speaker & inclusivity rider. It's a constant work in progress, and I understand smaller meetups and community events may not be able to meet all requirements. However, this rider does apply to **all commercial conferences.**

## The rider

**1. Code of Conduct**: There is public Code of Conduct linked available on your conference pages.

**2. Speaker Diversity**: as a white cis man, I count as "another white dude" at your event, and I want to see conferences showing off the truly diverse world we live in. The event will have _at least_ 40% non-white cis men speaking<super>✻</super>.

**3. Costs covered**: travel and lodging for all speakers is covered. Please note that I will not fly economy for long haul flights.

**4. Payment**: if I'm being paid for my talk, all other speakers are also paid _at least_ what I am being offered.

**5. Workshop payment** (if applicable): a full day (or multi-day) workshop is paid at either an agreed minimum fee or a 50:50 profit split.

<small>✻ I hope to see this number increase in time.</small>

These requirements are important to me because I'm in a position in my career that I can help towards making conferences more positive and safe in this small way.

I'd also like to add that I struggle with this kind of language and being able to articulate exactly what I want to see happen. I'm a skilled developer but not a skilled HR individual. However, I do know that a full line up of white men at an event is not something I can be part of any more and I want to be part of positive change in our industry.

## Making contact

Email is preferred and most reliable (as it gives us all a historical thread of conversation). If your email goes unanswered, please don't hesitate to re-email (my apologies).

You can email at [info@leftlogic.com](mailto:info@leftlogic.com) - this email goes to me and my business partner (who makes sure you receive a reply).

For best results, please include the following details if you can:

- Whether the rider requirements are fulfilled (or when you expect they'll be fulfilled if you're in the early planning stages)
- The date of the event
- The location of the event and nearest airport
- What you want me to speak about (ideally you have an idea)
