I finally made an effort to tighten up the design of my blog and word towards simplicity and legibility, removing a lot of the sidebar widgets and distractions.

This design also retrofitted a responsive design on top of what I already had, so now it looked great at any device width (or so I think!).

This was also the shift away from WordPress based blog and running entirely off my own code, and pushing all the source content directly into [GitHub](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com).
