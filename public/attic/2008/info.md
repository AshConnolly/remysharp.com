Entirely my own design (for better or worse), I remember working on this design on my commute back and forth to London, with limited knowledge of CSS and struggling with the hanging title images (and blog date).

The background image (which has stayed with me for the last 8 years) was made in Pixelmator, and to this day, I've no idea how to re-create it, but it represented what I wanted: a sort of visualisation of code (and my blog's content)â€”sharp hard edges, lots of blocks of information, all twisting away.
