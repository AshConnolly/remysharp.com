<ul>
	<li><P><B><A HREF="mailto:Julie<k972682@kingston.ac.uk>">Julie</A></B>: well yes, she always comes first, but that's mostly due to the fact I'm
		such a good lay.  Erm....well I guess I still love you, saying that looking 
		at @ndy's homepage on Angelfire he started saying how there was this
		<i>great</i> bird, now the <i>great</i> refers to her width.  <BR>Anyways, thank you
		for all the great blow jobs.  K-K T-T H-H S-S.</P>
	<li><P><B><A HREF="mailto:@ndy<andy.boyd@lineone.net>">@ndy</A></B>: Hello.  I know this site isn't up to my usual impressivenessness, but
		I'm only working on this poxy £35 486dx66 - which I must say although I do dis'
		it quite a bit, it's really pretty cool, and does the job.  Keep up the good work,
		in that you're littering the poor old Internet with useless sites: saying that I do
		litter your hard drive with my useless programs, at least someone is seeing
		my work.  Anywho, adios <B>dilhole</B>!</P>
	<li><P><B><A HREF="mailto:Banana Man<dayspring@bigfoot.com>">Graeme</A></B>: who only ever gives me a tiny little 'hello', so: hi.</P>
	<li><P><B><A HREF="mailto:Giant Squid<hg71ce@surrey.ac.uk>">Howard</A></B>: thank you for all of the forwarded mail - that I never read.
 		Still you have to love the poor soul, PS. did you ever get that snowball?
		If you got what was sent that would be about 150 email snowballs around
		Xmas. :-)  That was me.  If you didn't, pretend you never read this.<BR>
		Hope to see you soon, I've been rubbing my o-hole with vasaline for a 
		good two months now, so I should be able to accomodate you!</P>
	<li><P><B><A HREF="mailto:m.jackson@i_likeboys.com">Everyone else</A></B>: Ermm, if anyone sees their name in here and thinks that
		they should have a personal bit send me an email, otherwise: STOP MOANING.
		<BR>Hello to: Chris, Mum, Racheal, Danni, Bloke down the Road, All those that
		still speak to me from Worthing VIth Form, and erm...Dad?
