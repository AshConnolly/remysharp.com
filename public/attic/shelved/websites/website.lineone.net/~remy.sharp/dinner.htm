<H3>This is a story I wrote years ago.  In fact I wrote this for the last year of GCSE english.</H3><H3>
<BR>Well, now I've pretty much shown you eveything, so, enjoy the story.<BR>
Oh, and another thing, I didn't know, or in fact I hadn't even heard of Julie before I wrote this.</H3>
<P>Little bit of Dusk 'til Dawn in there I think, written in 1994!</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P><div class=story>
<P>I woke up late for the bus to go to school.  The alarm had needed to be set the day before and once again I had forgotten.  I dressed and ran down stairs to get my bag ready; Maths book, English book, then all the other books in sight were grabbed and thrown into the bag.
</P>
<P>The door slammed behind me as I hurled myself down the driveway to try to catch the bus to school.  I saw the bus driving towards the bus stop and I could see I was not going to make it, but still, I found the energy in myself to run for the bus stop, and to my surprise I made it to the bus stop before the bus did, this must have been a first.  It was pretty lucky that I did beat the bus to the stop, otherwise I would have had to walk a straight nine miles.  Our house was in the exact middle of nowhere, which meant I either had to travel nine miles to get to school or not go at all.  I preferred the latter, but my parents thought otherwise, and since living on a farm in the middle of nowhere means having no car, I have to wake up at ten past seven to catch the bus at twenty past; long walk, or a short run.
</P>
<P>Probably the only good thing about going to school by bus was that I was always there ten minutes before the bell.  This was good on the days it didn't rain, but as far as England in the winter went, there were not going to be any sunny days for a long time yet.  It was raining.
</P>
<P>As the day progressed so did the wind, rain, thunder, lightning, hail, you name it, it was falling from the skies, even 'cats and dogs' as one teacher had said earlier on in the day.  Although I worked well without distractions from the weather I did have one thing one my mind: how the hell am I going to get home without be being crucified by the weather?  Well the answer lay in the form of a good friend offering to house me until the weather cleared up, assuming each of our parents would agree.
</P>
<P>Despite living on a farm and having no car, and other luxuries, we did have a phone, thank God.  This meant all I had to do was to convince the secretary at the administration office that I had to use the phone.  After a good ten minutes of trying to get the phone off her I gave up.  I let the secretary know how I felt by muttering a wide array of different swear words while going through the door.  I heard her shout something after me but carried on walking.
</P>
<P>I found my friend, Simon, and told him how much trouble I had trying to use the phone.  I told him the secretary said - imitating her voice:
"If I let you use the phone, I would have the whole school wanting to use the phone, now we can't have that now, can we."
'Who's we?' I had thought, and 'Who actually cared.  Not me, and that's all I need to know.' Simon and me laughed at this and decided that I'd use the phone at Simon's house.  I would have got a lift to my house from Simon's parents, but they were away for the week and Simon had been left to take care of the house and his twin sister.  I actually quite fancied the idea of not having to go home and sleeping at someone else's house, especially the house of the girl of my dreams.
</P>
<P>The final bell was still ringing through my ears when I was walking to the gates to meet Simon.  I stood in the rain for two minutes, which, when waiting, standing still in the rain seemed like about half an hour.  Finally Simon emerged from the building and started to walk towards me with his coat awkwardly covering his head, although it seemed to work.  I asked him where was his (lovely, tasty, sexy, beautiful, attractive) sister - I didn't quite say that, but it was what I thought, he told me she had long gone.  So we started to make our way to Simon's house and still the rain and hail bolted down on us.
</P>
<P>When we finally reached Simon's house, the first thing I did was tell my parents where I was and that I was going to stay the night, luckily enough they didn't have a problem with that, they said something about having a peaceful and satisfying night on their own.  I left the phone with some pretty ugly ideas in my head.  I returned to Simon, who was already laying in a slump on his sofa watching the T.V.  I told him the news, and chose not to tell him what I thought my parents were going to do.
</P>
<P>We ended up watching the T.V. until about eleven o'clock, when Simon's sister walked in wearing a rather flimsy night dress, and said that she thought we'd better go to bed now.  She looked at me, my eyes had been resting upon her body while she had spoken to Simon, but now she was looking at me, and I had been caught in the act, my eyes flicked to her eyes and I said,
</P><P>"Ah, what, sorry, pardon." almost blurting out my words while trying desperately to fix my eyes on hers and trying to not make it obvious that I had been almost drooling over her.  She said,
</P><P>"Don't you think it's time to go to bed now?" my brain said,
</P><P>"Yes please", and I said,</P>
<P>"Errgh?"</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Er, yes." I swallowed hard as she turned to Simon and questioned him with her face.</P>
<P>"Well I've got an idea," Simon said, "We are going to go up to the old house, down by the church, and we're going to have a good look in."
</P><P>"I'm sorry?" I said in surprise, this house was an old deserted house rumoured to be haunted.  I did not fancy the idea of having the crap scared out of me, just because we have nothing else to do; "Can't we play bridge instead?" Simon laughed, taking it as a joke, and I smiled unsure.
</P><P>"Come on Julie," Simon's sister, "we're not scared, are we?" he said and looked at me.  I gulped, faked a smile and shook my head.
</P><P>"Plus," Simon continued, "I don't think you're going to disagree." He lent over to Julie and whispered something, her eyes widened, then quickly her face changed to a worrying frown, and she answered with,
</P><P>"You what, I don't know what you're talking about." She said while shaking her head.
</P><P>"Don't play with me, Julie, I found some pictures in your drawer last week."
</P><P>'Mind if I take a look at these alleged pictures?' I thought.</P>

<P>Julie looked like she had no choice, and me being a male, meant if I said is was scared to go I would never hear the last of it from Simon and any other macho males at our school.  So we all kitted ourselves up in rain gear, flash lights, and a small quantity of food, and then started to make our way up to the church where we would find the house.
</P>
<P>By the time we reached the church we were thoroughly soaked and fairly annoyed.  There had been nothing but complaining from the two twins, they may not look the same, but when they are moaning they can go on forever.  I was also shocked to find a down side to Julie, since I thought the sun shone out of her arse, the down sides hadn't occurred to me before.  Simon started to look around for this house.  Julie and I stood in the rain for around five minutes, and for that whole five minutes I got an earful of how Simon and I had forced her into coming.  At this stage I didn't really think the world of Julie, actually at that moment I thought she was a bit of a moaning bitch.  I asked her why had she agreed into coming at all, and she replied with total silence and a red and embarrassed face, I was quite shocked at the effect of talking about these so called pictures so I tried to remember this for later when she might be trying to talk my ears off.
</P>
<P>Simon came back with no idea of where the house was supposed to be, I thought to myself, 'How hard is it to find a huge ghostly house?  Not that hard as far as I knew'.  Then suddenly the skies opened up rain, sleet, snow, hail, lightning came hammering down on us.  The only shelter was the church, so all three of us ran for the archway of the church.  We stood, freezing and thoroughly wet.  We said we would wait for the rain to stop, then walk home, although there was the slight problem that it was pitch black, and even when we were standing about one foot apart, we could just make out each others faces.  Then I broke the silence:
</P><P>"Look if we don't do something we'll die of hypothermia"
</P><P>"Well what do you suggest?" Simon said.
</P><P>"Well...how about we find out whether or not anyone lives here," I turned and pointed to the church, "well, what do you think?"
</P><P>"I think you're outa' your mind," Julie said.
</P><P>"Well you can stick it." I replied, annoyed that Julie didn't have any better ideas but still had time to mock mine.
</P><P>"I guess we've no choice," said Simon sensibly.
</P><P>The door handle boomed against the old oak wood.  The door swung open, and a well built man with a dog collar answered:
</P><P>"Yes?" he said.
</P><P>We looked at each other hoping someone else would speak first.
</P><P>"Do you want something?" the man asked.  I swallowed and started to speak,
</P><P>"We were..." I was cut short with Simon trying to speak at the same time.  We looked at each other.  Then the man grabbed Simon, and lifted him to his toes.
</P><P>"Speak boy, what do you want?"
</P><P>"Er, yeah," he said rather fast, "Erm, well it's raining..."
</P><P>"I can see that."
</P><P>"Yeah, and er, we can't get back home 'til tomorrow, and we were wondering," he looked back to me, sheer fear in his eyes, "we were wondering if we could stay here for the night?"
</P><P>The man moved his head round to look at me and said,
</P><P>"Do you have faith?"
</P><P>'This dude's a PSYCHO' I thought, "Yes, yes we have faith, don't we Simon?"
</P><P>Simon nodded at the man and smiled.
</P><P>"Well then," he started while putting Simon down, "my house is your house.  Come in." He swayed his arm and directed us towards the lobby.
</P>
<P>We all walked into the lobby, then the man walked in front of us, stopped, and stood in a position that looked like he was looking us over, or inspecting us.  I stepped forward and introduced myself, the man looked at me as if I were a wall.
</P><P>"So what do you do here?" I said.
</P><P>The man walked past me slowly to the door and closed it.  We all had our backs to the man and the door, but we all heard the heavy bolt lock.
</P><P>"What do I do?  You are asking me what do I do?"
</P><P>"Well...yes", regretting I had said anything at all.
</P><P>I turned to look at him, and the first thing I saw was his eyes, and his locked to mine. The only way I could describe those eyes is totally psychotic.  Then he said;
</P><P>"I kill people." and he walked into what looked like a dinning room.  Dinner had already been set for four people.
</P><P>"Sit." he said firmly.  
</P><P>I could feel my heart smashing away at my chest.  We all moved swiftly towards the places that had apparently been laid out for us.  I sat opposite Julie and Simon sat at the bottom of the table.  The man walked out of the room, Simon was quick to move from his seat, but as soon as the chair moved the man shouted:
</P><P>"Dogs."  And two large dogs stood solidly at the entrance to the dinning room.
</P>
<P>Simon sat.
</P>
<P>I knew in each of our hearts we felt real fear, adrenaline pumping fast around our bodies.  The designs on the walls of the church were gruesome.  People with their faces being bitten off.  The whole room would put fear into a person.  It was huge, the table lay directly in the centre of the room.  The table looked like it had come from a scene from Dracula.  Engraved everywhere you could see on the table, horrible faces, stars, and other strange markings.  The cups on the table were full of what looked like either blood or red wine, I hoped it was wine.  On the ceiling of the dining room was a huge circular piece of glass, with a satanic star in it, and in the star was a picture of Jesus Christ on a crucifix, covered in blood, and next to him was a priest with wings, and on his face where he smiled blood drooled from his lips.
</P>
<P>The man returned.
</P>
<P>"Please, you are my guests until your death, please eat to your hearts content."
</P><P>The way he said his words was like he was going to kill someone at that point.  We all started to eat although I personally was not hungry.  The food tasted strange.  I asked,
</P><P>"What is it we're eating?"
</P><P>"You, you are eating liver" I was relieved that it wasn't something like rats intestines or something alike.  He continued, "the liver of a young boy from the village".  I felt immediately sick.  Almost vomited there and then.
</P><P>"The girl is eating the heart of a young child of ten years, and the boy, a man's brain."
</P><P>Julie stopped eating and started to scrape her tongue, she was then sick on her plate.
</P><P>Simon just stopped eating.  Julie went pale.  The man stood up and walked to Julie:
</P><P>"You don't look very well." He said.
</P><P>"What do you expect, you sick bastard." I shouted across the table.  The man tilted his head and looked at me,
</P><P>"I'm sick am I?"
</P><P>He grabbed Julie's hair in his fist and he started to kiss Julie.  Tears streamed down Julie's face.
</P><P>"What the hell do you think you're doing" Simon said.
</P><P>"I'm killing you" then the man pushed his hand down Julie's trousers, Julie's face changed severely.  Pain, extreme pain came over her face, Simon ran towards the man, and punched him.  The man just laughed, moved from Julie and pushed his fist through Simon's chest and out of his back.  Simon dropped to the ground, blood spewing from his body, soon covering the floor, by this time I was standing.  Julie screamed then turned and ran for the front door.  She made it to the door, but it was locked.  The priest gracefully moved towards her, smiling and laughing, not a happy laugh, but an evil laugh.  He picked her up by her neck.  I watched in dismay, I felt like my feet were in set concrete.  He looked back at me, then twisted Julie's head off.  Red was the colour of death, and red was the only colour I could see.  He turned to me and said:
</P><P>"Remember me?" and pointed to the ceiling.  He bowed his head and cried out, silver wings emerged from behind him.
</P><P>"Remember me now?" he repeated.  He threw his arms outwards, and looked up at me once more.  His eyes shining red blood trickling from his mouth.  He brought his arms back down, then turned the palms of his hand towards me and said,
</P><P>"Do you still have faith?"
</P><P>I looked at him.  Once a priest in a church, now a demon in a place of sanctuary from God.
</P><P>"Do you know what it feels like to die?" he continued "Of course you don't." He said slowly, with an evil smile.  I looked about myself again, the wet red floor, and then by the door, where Julie's head lay severed.  My stomach turned.
</P><P>"Feel the evil." He said.  And somehow he simply pushed his hands towards me and sent an intense amount of deadly evil into me.
</P><P>"NOW." He shouted.  And everything around me exploded a great mass of burning energy.  He moved towards me.  I could feel boundless pain running though my body.
</P><P>"That's the evil you feel, you'll soon be dead."
</P><P>"Why?" I tried to shout over the pain and the fire and the noise of destruction.
</P><P>He lifted his head, and tilted it, as if to question me.
</P><P>"You do not have to understand." With that he touched me.  Then I could feel the inside of my body coming apart.  Then the pure annihilation of my body and soul took place.  My last memory was that all this was a bit of fun.
</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I felt my body drifting upwards.
</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Voices calling.
</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The only colour is white.
</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=cv>I am dead.
