<UL><P class=info>Right, what does this pile of crappy software do?  Okay, you know you've got a 'Quick View' in Windows 95? Yes.  Good, now I found that when I want to view an Internet image (eg. gif or jpeg) I was wanting a quicker program, also one that stayed in memory.</P>
<P class=info>Well this is what it can do: opens gif, jpeg and bitmaps, once loaded when you click on the <B>x</B> the window goes away, but waits in the system tray for when you want to view the image again, or you're going to load another image.  And because the program is already loaded the only time taken to load is from the image.</P>
<P class=info>There is a self registration option in the menus, but I suggest you have a quick glance through the <B>bug list</B> because there may be a few.</P>
<P class=info>When you register a file type you can make LIST your default view by setting it to default in Explorer file type options, but when you go to launch you don't get the other associated program, you get LIST again.</P>

<LI><U><B>How to get it all up and running</B></U>

<UL><P class=info>The program only needs the extra dll to run and the standard visual basic 5 runtime libraries (can be found @ microsoft.com), otherwise: it won't.</P>
<P class=info>However you've got to manually register the dll yourself, and this is how you do it</P>

<ul><P class=info>Start menu, run: <code>regsvr32 c:\windows\system\ssubtmr.dll</code></P></ul>

<P class=info>I don't really know how copyright goes, but I do know that Steve McMahon, the author of SSubTmr.dll  has given permission for this dll to be used where no money is being made.  Now I could do with the cash but I have to honor the requests in the disclaimer, but it is legal so, don't worry about all that stuff.</P>

<ul><li><P class=info>If one program is the default view for all images (eg. gif, bmp, jpg, psp, eps, etc), LIST will assume to be a view for file types it cannot view.</P>
<li><P class=info>If you haven't got the Tohoma font then you'll get the about box in an slightly different look.</P>

<LI><U><B>What the program does</B></U>

<UL>
<P class=info>HTML v5 is an update on HTML Writer v4.  However there is a complete program change.</P>
<P class=info>v5 allows for user defined tags, styles, colours and links.  This is done through a simple to use text file.</P>
<P class=info>This program is a text based HTML editor, using simple commands.  v5 is aimed at people who want to know what HTML code they want to knock out, but can't be bothered to wait for a bigger program to load</P>
<P class=info>Also, I've added a bit of a personal touch in the splash screen and the about box, so if you think the program is not worth downloading, then you can still look at the personal touches bits for a laugh!</P>
</UL>
<LI><U><B>How to get it all up and running</B></U>
<UL>
<P class=info>Okay, there's a good chance that you don't have the Visual Basic 6 runtime files and the updated control files. You can test this by just downloading the program, and then trying it out.</P>
<P class=info>If the program comes up with an error, or says that there's a file missing, you're going to have to download the runtime libraries that I've supplied (it's under the link where you download v5).</P>
<P class=info>I've got a feeling that it won't like copying some of the files over the Windows file.  If you can't get Windows to give up, close down into DOS and then copy from there.</P>
<P class=info>The libraries are zipped up and then converted to executables so don't worry about things going doo-dah, just install the files where you want.</P>
<P class=info>And hopefully that's it.  If there are any problems you can email me from this site.  Good luck :-)</P>

<UL>
<P class=info>v4 is a simple and lightweight HTML editor.  In plain text, hence the simple, but it's neat and small.</P>
<P class=info>It allows a beginner who whats to learn the basics get producing simple HTML quickly.  Also allows a split view interface, meaning that you can view two html files at one time, this is useful for editing, checking consistant format, and copying text from another html file you can't be arsed to retype the whole thing.  </P>
<P class=info>v4 can also use HTML Colours if it's install on the computer, eg. when selecting a back colour rather than the preset colour, the user can chose 'other' and HTML Colours will launch automatically.</P>
