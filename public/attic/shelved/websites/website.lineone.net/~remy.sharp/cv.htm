<H3>Personal Profile</H3>
<HR class=cv>

<P class=cv>I feel that I am a particularly fast
learner. This ability helps me greatly when faced with new problems. For
instance my work done for Interactive Media which involved using some of the
newest techniques on the market.</P>

<P class=cv>During my A-levels I held the position of head of graphics
for the Student Union Magazine which involved the organisation and the
reformatting of the entire magazine.</P>

<P class=cv>Presently, in my free time, I am an active member of the
Kingston University Parachuting Club, and fully intend to run for the position
of president.</P>

<HR class=cv>

	<P class=cv>June &#150; October 1998</P>
	<P class=cv><B>Interactive Media</B><BR>
	379 London Road, Mitcham, CR4 4BF</P>
	<P  class=cv><I>Developed (along with three other team members) a web
	based back-end to information kiosks used by tourists in central London. This
	was accomplished using web-based tools, such as DHTML, Java and CGI
	programming, and involved a very steep learning curve. I concentrated on the
	CGI and Java side of the development, although I introduced some ideas for the
	Internet programming and realised them. Alongside a tutor from Kingston
	University, helped implement a computerised routing system into the kiosks.
	This assisted the tourist to get from one place to another using vector maps
	and written instructions, displayed in the web page.</I></P>
