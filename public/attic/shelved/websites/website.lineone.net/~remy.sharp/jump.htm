<P>Okay, so this weekend I go up to Peterborough.  Nice enough place, leaving London at 7:00pm getting 
	there at 9:00pm.  A good three to four hours of drinking.  So I drank.  I drank like it was going out of
	 fashion.  And bearing in mind I'm such a light weight, I was pretty much gone.</P>
<P>2:30am came, and I finally passed out.  Someone dragged me into bed, don't remember.</P>
<P>7:00am: Wake up.  Why?  Because I've got to jump out of a plane.  </P>
<P>Now, keeping in mind the state I was in the previous night, I assumed that it was a joke: no joke.</P>
<P>8:00am: I'm sitting on a bench wearing a jump suit, a parachute attached to my back, and freezing my
	 bollocks off.  -  Oh yes, and I forget to mention the fucking aeroplane sitting in front of me looking 
	very similar to a flying Skoda.</P>
<P>8:20am: 3,500 feet in the air.  Okay, the plane.  How can I describe this without making you think that 
	perhaps I was safe at any time...</P>
<P>Enough room for three jumpers, the jump master (the guy who tells you to get the fuck out of the plane,
	 yeah, like you want to listen to him), and the pilot.  We're all, and I don't just mean the jumpers,
	 we're all crouched down, knees against our chests flying at stupid angle to reach 3,500 feet in
	 the shortest time possible.  Also did I mention the door?  No?  That might have been due to the
	 fact, there was no door.  And poor little old me, who has never really (okay, never really was a 
	bad use of the English language, that should have read NEVER EVER) jumped out of a plane was
	 faced with a fucking great hole in the side of the plane.</P>
<P>To be honest I think if he had ascended clockwise rather than anticlockwise, I would have just slipped
	 out the plane, in a similar fashion as to when the barmaid is coming up to you with your three 
	pints on a tray.  You can see them tilting but you can nothing about, and as slow and gradual as 
	it is, you will not intervene, until the inevitable happens and the three pints (and if you haven't
	 worked out the associations; our three jumpers) slip out into the open air and plummet to their
	 sticky end.</P>
<P>So as you gather, I was just a little nervous, and on top of that I was going to be the first to jump [grin].</P>
<P>"OKAY.  NUMBER 1, IN THE DOOR"</P>
<P>That's me?</P>
<P>"GET INTO POSITION...LOOK UP..."</P>
<P>- oh look there's the sky, the 'look up' is to probably stop you from looking down onto the ground and
	 thinking 'sod that for a game of tennis!'</P>
<P>"GO!"</P>
<P>I jump, or more push myself, out of the plane.</P>
<P>Fucking-what-oh-one thousand, two thou...sheeeeiitttt.....</P>
<P>I do remember the single thought I had as I jumped: 'Why the fuck did I get out of the plane?'</P>
<P>'Look up...is the canopy there?  Yes.  Phew [wipe of the brow if I wasn't 3,500 feet in the air, and holding the
	 harnesses].  Hang on, there's some twists, kick them out boy - spin like you've never spun before!'</P>
<P>I was alive.  But I had also completely forgotten where I had to be now and at particular heights, and also,
	 where the fuck I was going.  And damn, it was windy (later to find out that as I left the plane
	 the wind speed hit it's limit for student jumpers).  </P>
<P>Facing into wind: no movement.  Facing down wind: and off to London we go.</P>
<P>Apparently there was a girl once who completely froze up after she jumped, and the drop zone, target, 
	setup point, all that went out of the window.  By a miracle she landed safely, but it was over two
	 miles away in Peterborough!</P>
<P>So there I was, trying not to drift too far from my landing pattern, when all of a sudden I've got to go 
	down wind to begin the landing pattern, then across, then into wind, and then a bit of zig-zagging
	 to burn off some of the distance.  Then I hear from my radio:</P>
<P>"Standby to flare....standby..........FLARE!"</P>
<P>We're supposed to flare at 15 feet, I'm telling you that was about 3 feet.  But I flared, dropped my knee
	 into one damn muddy field and stood up: VGT the jump master said, very good throughout. 
	 I was pretty chuffed.</P>
<P>I saw her [you know who] coming down to land, missing the drop zone by (what looked like quite)
	 a bit.  I could see her head as she plonked down, then she disappeared.</P>
<P>Story was that her canopy re-inflated and dragged her through some crops.  Her arse was covered in mud,
	 and her fingers were moulded together with the stuff.  But from what she said, she pretty much 
	loved it too.</P>
<P>We've got to do it again.  I think time we'll both be a little more willing to get out of the plane.  But 
	come on, you think about it, run this sentence over in your head:</P>
<P>'I jumped out of a plane last Saturday.'</P>
<P>Isn't that just the dumbest thought ever?  Well, not really, I think:</P>
<P>'I want to do it again: climb out of a plane at three and a half thousand (fucking) feet from the ground'</P>
<P>And I'm supposed to be doing a degree that shows I'm supposed to have a little bit of sense!</P>
