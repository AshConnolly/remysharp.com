This was the my first design straight from a wordpress theme, called *Unsleepable v16*. I remember customising it quite a bit with plugins, in particular with my own [last.fm plugin](/2007/07/26/lastfm-recent-album-artwork-plugin). As you might see from the *tag cloud*, jQuery and TextMate were very much central to my development and my blogging!
