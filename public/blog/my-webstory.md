# My #WebStory

This month in 2019, the W3C turns 25 and in their [blog post](https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/10/what-are-your-webstories/) they encourage others to share their own web stories.

So here's mine. It starts in the 80s with a Sinclair ZX81.

(Yes, I'm going to rewind this far back!).

## Childhood

I was lucky/privileged enough to grow up in a household that had home computers from the early 80s. Specifically this meant we went through various incarnations of Sinclair machines. Though my first experience of computing was the ZX81, it was really the ZX Spectrum 48K that holds the strongest memories.

It was this machine that I copied my first machine listing from a magazine for a Stars Wars text based game. I remember being in the box room in our house for hours (and what felt like even more hours), prodding at the keyboard over and over, maliciously coping the listing. After god knows how long, I was finally able to run the program.

Oddly with BASIC and the Spectrum, or certainly the listing I was working on, there was no way to run the code at intermediate steps. Not the way I would code today. Today I could write a little HTML, CSS or even JavaScript and I'd hit refresh and I'd know if I had a bug or not. Early error warning.

Suffice to say: **not work**. Error messages were not useful and after being extremely disappointed, I had to abort.

I did however return to the speccy to write my own software. It was something simple, a secret message store, but it was mine. I had created it from nothing except my own ideas. As a child I had some small control over the world that was still so big to me.

Using code to create a thing from nothing became a natural thing. Something I'd take for granted.

## The PC era

Around 1992 I turned 14 and I was bought an Intel [486](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486) (yes, did I mention privileged kid?). The internet wasn't widely available and in fact I was dialling into a local [BBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) - if I recall correctly, the _only_ BBS in my town (in the UK we had to pay for local calls but these were the cheapest).

BBS' opened me up to a connected network of machines. This was the internet but not the web. Not yet. But my experience with the 486 give me the confidence with PCs that I'd need for when I'd arrive at Kingston university
