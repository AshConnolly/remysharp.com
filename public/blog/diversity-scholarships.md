# Diversity Scholarships for ffconf

This post outlines a new diversity scholarships programme that I want to introduce for [ffconf](http://ffconf.org). It's entirely possible that this does not apply to you, my dear reader, but you still have an important role to play: please pass on the message and [this link](http://ffconf.org/scholarship) to help seek those out who can make use of the scholarships.

## What are the scholarships?

Scholarships are available for anyone in an under-represented group in tech. This includes (but is not limited to): people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, women and disabled people.

We have a limited number of scholarships available which includes a ticket to the day ffconf event, travel to Brighton (from your city) and hotel as required.

## How to apply

Please answer the following questions and email [Julie](mailto:julie@leftlogic.com) or [myself, Remy](mailto:remy@leftlogic.com). You don't have to explain your personal situation to us (but you can of course, if you want to). We trust you in this point :)

1. Who are you?
- Where would you be travelling from (airport or city)?
- What do you do?
- Why should you get a scholarship?

Please note that your email will be treated with the utmost privacy, and we will not publicly announce who the diversity scholarships go to (though you're welcome to say so yourself).

**Deadline for applications: Friday 2nd Oct, 2015.**

## Why?

In the early part of this year I had the idea that we could get every delegate to ffconf a "keep cup" with a nice simple ffconf logo on it as a cool little souvenir of the event. Something to make what is already (hopefully) a great day, that tiny bit more special.

The costs came back quoting us around £1,300. Not a huge amount, but it would also come out of my company, Left Logic's pocket.

Then a few days ago I saw [this tweet from Una Kravets (@una)](https://twitter.com/una/status/636643450754994176). She posted how she was able to attend SassConf 2013 through a diversity programme they provided, and has gone on to travel, speak, start a meetup, and closes with:

> [...] All of this is possible for me because I got that scholarship in 2013. Scholarships aren't just about increasing diversity numbers, or financial assistance: they can change an attendee's life.

I hadn't quite wrapped my head around what a diversity scholarship looked like until I read Una's post in full, and then it clicked. The same night, I decided that instead of spending our money on something that was nice for a large group - we should spend this money on providing flight and hotels for diversity tickets.

So we have rounded the budget up to £1,500 for flights and hotel for at least 3 people (though it all depends on where you fly from, i.e. a diversity scholarship for someone travelling from Australia will blow our entire budget), but we'll stretch it as far as we can.

Again, this scholarship isn't sponsored, this is from Remy and Julie. No, I don't want a medal(!) just trying to help in a small way.

Again, if this doesn't apply to you, please please can you pass on the message and reach out to anyone you know that might benefit from one of these scholarship places.
