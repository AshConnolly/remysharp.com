# Life Streams with Yahoo Pipes (screencast)

[Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com) is "an interactive feed aggregator and manipulator".  The service easily allows you and me to create a feed of feeds, sometimes known as 'life streams', though I like to call them: soup.

Here's a screencast showing how easy it is to create a stream of your online activity, and the JavaScript required to add the feed to your blog with a bit of sexy icon magic too boot.

[Download the QuickTime screencast, 55Mb, a little over 10 minutes](http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/yahoo-pipes.mov)

<small>If you can't view the screencast, try [DivX Web Player](http://www.divx.com/divx/webplayer/) for Windows or the Mac.</small>

You can also see a [working demo](http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/soup.html) of the soup in action (just view the source to see the JavaScript used).

The Yahoo pipes are a pretty impressive tool, but the once thing I find lacking is the ability to modify the output, in particular, I would really like to know the source of the feed when aggregating feeds.  That said, if anyone know how - do let me know.

As always, let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
