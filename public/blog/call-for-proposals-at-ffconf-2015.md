# Call for proposals at ffconf 2015

[ffconf](http://2015.ffconf.org) has it's event date (6-Nov 2015) and I've been in the process of carefully curating the content I want to hear at this year's event again.

As always, I also make sure I allot a few positions for CFP, so here's what our CFP looks like.

If you think you've got something to share, then get in touch. I've included a few guidelines as to what I prefer from a proposal, and given you an idea of the kinds of topics I'm interested in hearing about this year.

You can also follow the [@ffconf](https://twitter.com/ffconf) twitter account for the latest announcements.

## Proposal topic advice

I've also included what you can expect as a speaker at our event too.

A few topics that are of particular interest to me:

- Isomorphic JavaScript code and applications (ideally outside the world of "easy with React")
- Sysops for web developers (I'm particularly interested in Docker/container solutions for web developers)
- What we can learn in web development from other technology/disciplines
- "You're doing it wrong"

If you want to get an idea of the audience or who you proposal is for, the answer is simple: me. I curate for content that *I want to hear and see*. So if you (roughly) know my work, then you know the audience.

Topics that don't work, unless they're genuinely going to change the World, then CFPs like these generally fall to the bottom of the pile (sorry!):

- Big library specific talks (React, Ember, Angular, jQuery, etc)
- Your company's new shiny product
- Talks that are very similar to recent years of ffconf talks

Send me the title of your talk, an outline of the talk and any extra information you want me to know about the idea: [events@leftlogic.com](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=ffconf2015%20speaking%20propsal).

**It takes me a long time to process and decide on CFPs, so whilst there's no 8 sessions up on the site, it means your talk is still up for consideration. I will respond to everyone with a yay or nay eventually.** If you want to come to ffconf, regardless of whether your CFP is selected, please buy a ticket and if your talk is selected, the ticket will be refunded and returns to the public pool of tickets.

## Our promise to you

All our speakers are treated the same. We will:

- Pay for your travel. If you're flying long haul, we'll upgrade you to premium class (or whatever the name is for "above economy")
- Put you up in our "speaker hotel". It's not that cool, but it's right in town and two minutes walk from our venue. We're also open to offering the hotel stay. If you want an extra day or two here and there, then that's cool too (obviously if everyone does this, it breaks our bank, but so far it's worked)
- Arrange your travel and help you with anything you need ahead of the event
- We can, if you need or want it, provide you with a mifi preloaded with data
- All your food and drinks provided for you during the day before and the day of the conference (don't expect to buy a drink at the after party)
- 40 minute talk, generally we don't do Q&A and it's best to err on the side of "there is no wifi"
- Â£500 honourium - I know it's not much, but it's a bit of spending money to say thanks
- A free pass to the next ffconf, and for evermore part of our growing and much loved speaker alumni
- If you bought a ticket for ffconf2015, we'll refund the ticket (as we don't expect, or want, our speakers to pay)

So I hope to hear from you soon!
