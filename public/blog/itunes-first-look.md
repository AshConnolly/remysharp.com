# iTunes first look

September 12th, [Apple](http://www.apple.com) launches [iTunes 7](http://www.apple.com/itunes), and there's a few cool features knocking around their announcements too.

From a quick play with iTunes when I got home from work, I've found the following features: 

1. Searching for gapless tunes - and the ability to join CD tracks - i.e. that one lonely dance album you've got can finally be heard in it's true DJ mix.
2. Album artwork from the Apple store.
3. The link to iTunes only appears on the selected song (finally!).
4. New views: grouped with artwork, or with (new) [cover flow](http://www.apple.com/itunes/jukebox/coverflow.html).
5. Subtle new style, hinting towards the feel of [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/index.html).
6. A much improved iPod management interface, with tabs allowing you to view each content type of your iPod.

Sadly, movies and TV shows are still [unavailable in the UK](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=102772946&s=143441) :-(

For the 5th-gen iPods: games.

Not those crappy block games, real games.  High definition version of Tetris, Mini Golf, Mahjong, Pac Man and a number of others.  Going for Â£3.99 in the UK, $4.99 in the US.

Nice work.  I think I'll buy me a game, download all my artwork from Apple and listen to that [Kiss](http://kiss100.com) album the way it was supposed to be heard.
