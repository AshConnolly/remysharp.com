# Little Miss Sunshine (4/5*)

[Little Miss Sunshine][LMS] is essentially a road trip movie about a dysfunctional family.  I say dysfunctional, I actually thought [Greg Kinnear's][Greg] character was a step father.

It's an observational comedy with an eclectic cast, including [Steve Carell][Steve] of [40 Year Old Virgin][Virgin] fame.

A great film that I found myself laughing out loud, oddly enough, one of the funniest characters was actually their mode of transportation - but I'll you find that out yourselves.

There's some really special moments in this film that makes it stand out from the average road trip with a kooky family, and the younger members of the cast stand up well against heavyweights like [Toni Collette][Toni].

Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

Directed by: [Jonathan Dayton](http://imdb.com/name/nm0206760/) & [Valerie Faris](http://imdb.com/name/nm0267512/) (husband & wife team)

A touching and equally funny tale with believable characters trying to do the right thing and get through their lives.
