# dub-dub-dub, or: How we pronounce the World Wide Web.

At my office, during some point in 2004 someone got tired of referring to the company web domain as (in phonetics): double-u, double-u, double-u, dot, digital look dot com. So, he slurred the longest part in to 'dub-dub-dub'.

The result was a team of professional developers speaking to clients about our web site like we're half cut!

<abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> or the World Wide Web.  It's got it's use, but why do we still attach it to the front of our web addresses?

There was a point in the past where the web was new to everyone, and more importantly, there were other online services just as common as <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>.  

So, if someone was saying to have a look at their web page, probably just a bulletin at the time, the WWW part would tell us that it was served over HTTP.

Times are a changin'.  In fact, times **have** changed.  If you hear 'visit [bbc dot co dot uk, slash radio one](http://bbc.co.uk/radio1) - you know that means [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1).

This begs the question: why did you add the 'www'?  What does it mean?

It means it's a web page on the Internet.  Well, you knew that already didn't you?

You don't send emails to [coxy@mail.bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/weekends/saracox/biog.shtml) because it's an email - your email program does the math for you.  For those non-techs - your email is sending through a protocol called <abbr title="Simple Message Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr> - which *knows* the email needs to go to an email server.

So, why did you add the 'www'?  You don't need to*.

What's worse is that 'WWW', to say out loud, is 9 syllables long! 'World Wide Web' is only 3 - so actually it's backward to abbreviate let alone add it to all the web site addresses we visit.

<small>* I say you *don't* need to - perhaps you should take this with a little pinch of salt.  I know of a few web sites that act differently if you drop the leading 'www', but this is something we can campaign for together can't we?</small>
