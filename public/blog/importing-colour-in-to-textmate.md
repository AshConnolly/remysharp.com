# Importing colour in to TextMate

While I was working on one of my client's web site, I realised that I hadn't taken any note of the (hex) colours during my mock up phase.

Initially thinking I should download a colour picker, I realised I could probably drag and drop.

I popped open the colour selection tool in Preview (shift + apple + c), selected my colour and dropped it straight in to [TextMate](http://macromates.com).

I captured it as a [screencast](http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/textmate-import-colour-screencast.mov) which is just under 1Mb, created using the rather cool [iShowU](http://shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html).
