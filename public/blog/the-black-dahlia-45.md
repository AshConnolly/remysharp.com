# The Black Dahlia (4/5*)

[Brian De Palma](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000361/) directs [another American period](http://imdb.com/title/tt0094226/) film that flows with lush sets, and equally lush actors.

If you enjoyed [LA Confidential](http://imdb.com/title/tt0455143/), then you'll probably enjoy this film (but that may have a lot to do with [James Ellroy](http://imdb.com/name/nm0255278/) having written both films).

[Josh Hartnett](http://imdb.com/name/nm0001326/) plays Bucky, the young good looking, all round nice guy, well - aside from sleeping with his best friend's wife and all...

[Scarlett Johansson](http://imdb.com/name/nm0424060/) plays the <strike>eye candy</strike> female interest in the love triangle, completed by [Thank You for Smoking](http://imdb.com/title/tt0427944/)'s [Aaron Eckhart](http://imdb.com/name/nm0001173/) (who Julie points out promotes a film from TYFNS where beautiful people smoke, and this, is in fact **that** film!).

The characters stories weave fairly well in to one another, making me feel like I was hanging on to the plot right up until then end, where I hoped for an easy ending that would serve up whos, whys and whats.  Alas, I needed to pay attention closer.  It's a good film, but at the same time, it's going to keep you thinking.

Finally, I have to add that against those lush visuals, there's a couple of moments of violence that actually took me by surprise, and that's from the Remy giggled all the way through [Brain Dead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103873/)!  Oh - and there's a surprising amount of *crazy* in the film - watch out for it!

Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

Directed by: [Brian De Palma](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000361/)

Very easy on the eye if you're a boy or a girl.  Lush sets and perfect hair styles everywhere!  The story telling is slow, gentle process, but kept me engaged throughout the film, and even wincing out loud at times!
