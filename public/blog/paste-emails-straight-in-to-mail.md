# Paste emails straight in to Mail

I'm running Mail 3 on Leopard, and all my accounts are <abbr title="Internet Message Access Protocol">IMAP</abbr>, I just found something that surprised me (it could well have been there all the while).

When I had the following in my clipboard:

<pre><code>,

random.</code></pre>

...and paste whilst looking at an inbox in Mail, it created a new unread email with the contents as:

<pre><code>random.</code></pre>

So, if you copy this:

<pre><code>From: steve@apple.com
Subject: You're hired

Dear thingy, 

We liked your mad skillz so much, we're going to 
throw money at you.</code></pre>

And paste it in to Mail, you'll find a new email.

Might be fun for a practical joke at some point...
