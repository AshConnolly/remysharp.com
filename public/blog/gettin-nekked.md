# Gettin' Nek'ked.

Again this year Dustin Diaz has thrown down the gauntlet as asked volunteers to strip off for [CSS naked day](http://www.dustindiaz.com/naked-day-07/) this coming Thursday.

I've installed the [plugin](http://guff.szub.net/2006/04/03/css-naked-day/) and I'm ready for that chilly moment when I drop the <abbr title="(Made up?) slang for my pants">kackies</abbr> off this web site.

However, I'm not really sure I'm really risking that much in this time of standards.  My blog is driven by [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), and the setup is pretty much straight out of the box, so really I'm not responsible for the quality of the structure (i.e. I don't deserve the credit).

The real question is whether I strip [Left Logic](http://leftlogic.com) of it's design.  I'm proud of it's underlying structure, and I'm in the final throws of a redesign that's almost entirely CSS based (i.e. I've not needed to change anything structurally).  

Then, my next big question I should consider, is whether I keep Left Logic naked until the redesign is ready - but I may have a potential looking at it soon...but then if they look now, it's pretty awful - certainly the front page is terrible.  Perhaps I'll think about this one...

Here's a sneak preview of Thursday in the mean time:
