# Merry Chrimbo to you and to me

Merry Christmas all - and a pre-emptive happy new year!  

In other news, [my entry](http://remysharp.com/2006/12/19/css-mastery-ipod-giveaway/) for [Andy Budd's Santa letter](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2006/12/and_the_winner_is/index.php) won a copy of [his book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/CSS-Mastery-Advanced-Standards-Solutions/dp/1590596145/sr=11-1/qid=1167043545/ref=sr_11_1/203-4711300-6173524) and a 2gb iPod Nano.  Superb! 

Congratulations to those who also won the book.

So, after some deliberation, I decided it was the right thing to return the reindeer, not before forcing him at carrot-point to pose for my chrimbo postcard.

Merry Christmas ya'll!

Don't ask where the snow came from, let me just say I wasted a lot of caster suger...
