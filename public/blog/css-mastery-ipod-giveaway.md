# CSS Mastery iPod Giveaway

[Andy Budd](http://andybudd.com) (of [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com)) has blogged about his [CSS Mastery and iPod Christmas giveaway](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2006/12/win_an_ipod_nano_with_css_mastery_this_christmas/index.php), and since the entries are a little thin on the ground, I thought maybe I should publish this...

Admittedly I actually sent this letter to the North Pole last week, which kind of makes me feel silly, since Andy is giving his book away for a lot less than what I went through to prepare my letter to [Old St. Nick](http://www.new-life.net/st-nick.htm).

Hopefully Santa won't take it too personally. Anyone know a good home for a reindeer?!
