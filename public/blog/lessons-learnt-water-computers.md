# Lessons Learnt: Water + Computers

Trying to keep healthy had go through a few pints of water each day, today I learnt a fairly cardinal of water near computers.

If you have trouble with simple actions, such as: picking a glass of water up, then you're going to be in trouble.

So, I pretty much threw half a glass of water over my computer.  No, actually - it wasn't just my computer, it was a G5 and my Powerbook sitting next to it.  

I held my breath, disconnected the only cable near the water and gently wiped the water off my beloved machines.

::sigh::

The lesson here, put the glass of water on the **other** side of the desk ;-)
