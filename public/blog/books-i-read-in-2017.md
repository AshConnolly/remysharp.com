# Books I read in 2017

I starting reading "properly" at the end of 2016 and carried on into 2017. At this stage, I was just (mostly) rating my books, but by the end of 2017, I started writing short reviews (mostly for myself).

The boost in reading is almost entirely down to using a Kindle, larger fonts and large line heights.

<span aria-label="5 stars out of 5">★★★★★</span>

I loved this story. It helps that I'm a dad with a son who has some similarities to the characters, but I found this story so warm and loving. I also found myself dragging the ending out just so that I could continue to have these characters in my life a little longer.

I loved this book. I'm not a fan of the apocalyptic stories, but this is so well told both from the storyline, but also the \_way\_ the story was written and each chapter is given from the perspective of the character (whilst still being 3rd person)—that I couldn't put the book down. Love it.

<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>

<p>Loved it. I happened to read this directly after the &#39;86 Fix, and although it didn&#39;t have the same &quot;retro&quot; feel of the first book, it was superb all the same.  </p>
<p>Some parts of the storyline were actually quite bleak, with the hard reflective thoughts that go with &quot;what if&quot; - I really enjoyed this.  </p>
<p>It ties up a bit overly perfectly at the end, but after following Craig across the two books, and all the hardships he goes through, I was actually quite see Craig have a happy ending!</p>

A beautiful tale, and the detail of the characters, their surroundings and the history throughout the book made me often wonder if it was actually a biography!

The entire story is a eloquently walk through a character's life whose choses to made the best of what they have, and left me wanting to see things the same in my.own daily life.
