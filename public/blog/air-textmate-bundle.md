# AIR TextMate Bundle

<div class="update"><p><strong>Updated:</strong> 10-Apr 2008</p><p>I should really add now that I spotted a couple of mistakes in the bundle which have been fixed.  If anyone uses this and spots anything amiss - let me know and I'll sort it.</p></div>

I've just finished attending the AIR tour and during the final (particularly funny) presentation, I completed a TextMate plugin that has **full** API completion support.

[Download the TextMate bundle](/downloads/Air.tmbundle.zip)

It was scraped from the [JavaScript API reference pages](http://livedocs.adobe.com/air/1/jslr/index.html).

I'll post more info that I've learnt - and probably turn the API scrapper (via jQuery) in to an AIR app if anyone wants it.
