# On making ffconf a safe place

Last week, [ffconf v7](http://2015.ffconf.org) was released, and going by all the tweets, photos and personal interactions I received, it was a **huge** success. Again. Phew.

However, as dug past the congratulations I found two things that upset me. I wanted to address them in this post.

## A precursor

Nothing that I'm about to outline is a breach of the [Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com) which we use for ffconf. What I mean to say is that ffconf is *my* event, and if I feel something is wrong, I want to fix it.

**I want ffconf to be a safe environment for all that attend.** I will do this at the expense of blocking individuals from attending if I have good reason to do so.

This is me, using my position of privilege to make ffconf a safer environment for all.

## Recruiters

I'm not against companies looking to recruit. Indeed most companies in web tech are trying to recruit talent and that's perfectly fine. It's fine because those companies and individuals representing these companies are there to enjoy the event, learn and socialise afterwards.

However, recruiter *networking*, aggressively working the room at the after party is unpleasant for many. In fact, I've heard directly from many attendees that said it was unwanted attention.

Like having a recruiter *pretending* to be a developer (or pretending to have some knowledge of your field), then glazing over when you *do* start to talk technical and glancing at their boss looking for a way out.

Or being told that you should move to London because that's where all the work is. Or being emailed with false claims about ffconf, and how the recruiter can *get you* some JavaScript developers.

There are two reasons why this is not okay: the first is that it's cold-call, *hard sell* approach to sales. It's uncomfortable and unpleasant for those being approached.

The second is **most importantly** the tickets taken up by these recruitment companies should have gone to people that would have genuinely benefited from the event. **This** is the reason that I will make changes for 2016's event to prevent recruiters from the event.

## "It's okay, that's just men"

In particular, at ffconf I asked the amazing [Lena Reinhard](https://twitter.com/lrnrd) to give a talk about community, open source and diversity. Lena's talk was awe-inspiring. Extremely heavy content and extremely powerful messages.

As [one attendee](https://twitter.com/almostobsolete/status/662679575932092416) put it: "some difficult and uncomfortable truths".

Then when (at least) one individual is both talking during the session and after, **loudly, making sure he's heard by nearby men & women** that he does not agree and dismisses these ideas, what *he* is saying to the women is: "I do not have respect for you".

When I heard about this from a few of the women that attended our event, although they were offended, they passed it off with *that's just men, I've seen worse*.

I understand why, but it's not okay with me. I want to create a safe space at ffconf, and I want attendees to know that it is *not* acceptable.

**I know this will take time, and this will take years (since our event is once a year), but I will follow through on this, and I will create a safe and respectful space in ffconf.**
