# Second Life in Brighton

[Second Life](http://secondlife.com) are setting up UK development offices in Brighton and [looking for new staff](http://www.wiredsussex.com/news/0703/linden.asp).

What's more interesting, is that this job post actually lends weight to something I've been saying for a few years now: Brighton is the UK's answer to San Francisco.

In particular, Second Life is based in San Francisco now, and:

> it seems the company is hoping the move will attract staff that is not willing to relocate to the corporate HQ in San Francisco, but still want to work on Second Life...

Brighton is affectionally known as the 'London by Sea' - but I think it's actually the San Fran of the UK.  Cool, chilled, hilly :-), and full of funk (and not that smelly kind you find walking through the streets of London!)

I'm sure others may not share my opinion, but hey, you gotta love the city you're with, right?
