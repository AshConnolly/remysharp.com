# Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are, IMHO, being used for more and more funky functions.

I really like the Facebook and Tumblr bookmarklets that scoop out information about the type of content you want to post and then sends them off to the respective sites.

[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) recently reposted his [JavaScript Bookmarklet Builder](http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/javascript_bookmarklet_builder) - which is useful, but if you're planning on writing a bookmarklet, there's a lot more to consider than just escaping characters.

So prompted by this opinion, I've compiled a list of tips I've learnt from writing various bookmarklets, from simple jQuery injection to the [Speech Bubble](http://leftlogic.com/lounge/articles/speech-bubbles/) app.
