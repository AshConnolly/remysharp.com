# A Friday Meme: How did you get started?

This may well have been done before, who knows, but I came across a great question on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com): how did you get started in computing?

My dad bought lots of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRASH_(magazine)">specy mags</a>, and somewhere in the mid 80s, he sat me down in the office (read: shoe box bedroom) with several pages of [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language) for a Star Wars game.  I recall spending at least 4 hours typing away a ZX Spectrum, key by key, reams of BASIC until I was finally finished.

Did it run?  Hell no! Probably an <code>Invalid argument</code> or <code>Variable not found</code>, who knows!  Although it was great experience (in beginning) to learn to touch type.

How did you get in to *this* business?
