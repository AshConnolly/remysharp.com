# My 2019

Continuing a [growing tradition](https://remysharp.com/search?q=my-20) on my blog, and apparently a growing trend on (what's left of) the web, here's my 2019. The most me-me-me post I have for the year.

## Professional

My professional life continues to tick along, and [my business](https://leftlogic.com) turned 13 years old last September. My clients continue to have a broad range and come from different countries (odd, rarely if ever coming from Brighton, my home town) and I'm fortunate enough that client work continues to come in.

However, my biggest highlights from the year have based around my extracurricular activities.

- **CERN**: In February I was invited (back) to CERN to join a small team of excellent individuals to recreate the WorldWideWeb - the world's first browser. It was an amazing event to be part of and a real honour to be part of the team. It was the kind of experience that I'd wish for anyone in our industry and would return to in a heart beat. You see the output of our work at [worldwideweb.cern.ch](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/) and read my account  of the week: [1](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/12/cern-day-1), [2](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/13/cern-day-2), [3](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/14/cern-day-3), [4](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/15/cern-day-4) and [5](https://remysharp.com/2019/02/18/cern-day-5)
- **A talk with Jeremy**: Jeremy Keith was asked if he would give a joint talk with me at Fronteers 2019 about the CERN project. Our biggest concern was performing a two person talk as I've rarely seen these done well. Suffice to say it went extremely well. It was a real pleasure and honour to speak along Jeremy particularly as I remember days back in 2005 reading [DOM Scripting](https://adactio.com/journal/1029) and later meeting Jeremy in (what was called) The Office and he un-surreptitiously [took a photo of me](https://www.flickr.com/photos/adactio/1807647949/). So it's nice that I've risen (or he's sunked) to a level where we can share the stage.
