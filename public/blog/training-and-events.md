# Training and events

There's a number of upcoming events I wanted to blog about, partly to lend a hand to their promotion, and partly to tell you what I'm up to.

## Workshops

Workshops over the last 12 months have really increased for me - both in public workshops (often via events) and private company workshops. I've now finally got so much HTML5 content that companies can now create a "pick and mix" HTML5 workshop spanning over anything from 1 to 4 days.

I'm up in Manchester next week doing private workshops for the BBC on mobile web dev. Possibly [my favourite quote](https://twitter.com/sparrk/status/156437912546836481) from the last time I ran this event was from James O'Brien aka @sparrk:

> Remy's HTML5 for mobile workshop showed me how to do at least three things I'd previously thought were impossible.

There's a few public workshops you can attend, starting with:

- [Mobile HTML5 Web Apps](http://mobilism.nl/2012/workshops#mobile-web-apps) - Amsterdam [&euro;350](https://mobilism.paydro.net/)
- [3 workshops: HTML5, Mobile and Node](http://developerfocus.com/kurskalender.aspx?lang=no1&cat=170376) - you'll have to pick me out in the table, based in London though

I'll also be releasing a new workshop for Full Frontal - so [keep an eye out](http://twitter.com/fullfrontalconf) for that :)

## Talks

- [SourceDevCon](http://sourcedevcon.eu/) - talking about using Node to go real-time (with a healthy dash of HTML5)
- [Mobilism](http://mobilism.nl/2012) - on debugging mobile devices and the pain and some technique (also [10% discount off regular ticket price](https://mobilism.paydro.net/event/amobilism-2012/RemySharp) (whilst stocks last!))
- [Future of Web Design](http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2012/) - on how developers and designers can work better together (or at least from my perspective!)
- [Reasons to be "Appy"](http://www.reasonstobeappy.com/) - mobile debugging again - this time in London (a small conference with only 250 places)
- [NDC 2012](http://www.ndcoslo.com/) - on the lesser known (or used) technologies in and around HTML5 that I think should be worthy of your attention
- [From the Front](http://2012.fromthefront.it/) - the same HTML5 talk, but this time in Italy (early bird tickets still on sale until end of April)

I'm sure more talks will turn crop up and there's a talk in me that I want to give about what I've learnt in developing JSBin over the last 4 years.

## If you want me to talk...

Do [get in touch](http://leftlogic.com/contact) (via my company site) if you've got an event and want to hear one of these talks, or equally if you company would like some in-house training.

Otherwise, I look forward to seeing and meeting some of you at the upcoming events!
