# I am a web developer. Not an engineer.

> Something I’m starting to realise and accept for myself: I’m a web developer. Not an engineer. Mostly an approach & understanding difference

– Me, [6-Feb 2015](https://twitter.com/rem/status/563708407337996288)

This seemed to strike a chord with a few people, and others asked if I could embellish on those thoughts. So here it is.

## On titles

"We" love titles. Personally, in the last 5 years, I've preferred the *sound* of being an engineer, or a JavaScript engineer. I actually quite like *software designer*. But let's face it, it's all fluff.

Actually, where titles aren't fluff, is when you work in a larger company. Quite often titles relate directly to pay scales. I digress.

The *engineer* bit is a little less fluffy and does actually carry meaning.

## Engineers

Calling yourself an engineer, when you're not actually qualified as an engineer is *sort of* a no-no. In fact, there's some [regulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer#Regulation) around the engineering titles - and certainly in the UK (according to the Wikipedia page), there's been petitions to protect the title.

Ignoring the regulations, to me, engineers are smart, educated (ideally in a form of engineering...) and specifically: solving complex computer engineering problems.

In a conversation (over twitter) I was having with [Trek Glowacki](https://twitter.com/trek), midway he replied with:

> Take a step back and understand the real engineering goal: SRP

I wasn't aware of any engineering goal, nor what [SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) stood for, nor did I *really* understand what the Wikipedia page was saying to me.

Honestly, I kind of feel out of my depth amongst engineers aka those people who *really" took the time to study computer science and grok the shit out of it.

## I am web developer

I don't know why I thought it was uncool to be a "web developer". Perhaps because it's utterly vague.

What "web developer" *does* mean *to me* though, is this:

Someone who writes code for browsers. Likely from the school of view source, is comfortable with drop-in libraries, understands standards and *best practice* techniques. But mostly, **a tinkerer.**

## I am not alone

![Tim Berners-Lee: web developer](https://remysharp.com/images/tbl-developer.jpg)

The picture above is an (infamous) screen grab from the [Web Platform](http://www.webplatform.org/) introduction [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug6XAw6hzaw). Of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The *creator* of The Web.

I saw a lot of posts and tweets suggesting that this was a joke, or a disservice to his work, or that the title was utterly understated.

I'm not sure it was. There's no doubt that this man is responsible for a *lot* more, but he *is* The Web Developer.

I'm proud to say that I work on that same web. Making it better (and sometimes, perhaps, a little worse).

## Embrace it

I've personally learnt my web development skills over a long period of time and nearly entirely through trial and error. I suspect most of us have.

Being a web developer doesn't have to mean you have to be a JavaScript wiz, or that you *don't* touch the server side. By virtue of tinkering, it's quite likely you're getting better at *all* these things.


Coming to this realisation is by no means a slur against those people who call themselves engineers. If you do, it's quite likely I already have a great deal of respect for your knowledge and understanding if I've come across your work already.

As for me, I'm proud to say: I am a web developer. I am a tinkerer.
