# Merry Chrimbo to all!

I hope Santa brought you everything you wished for (including receipts) and the wine and cheese was flowing accordingly.

There's still the new years eve parties to attend, but I've been told by the wife that all 'crap' food has to be consumed by the 2nd of Jan - diets ahoy!
