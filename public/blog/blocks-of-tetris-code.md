# Blocks of Tetris code

- Virtual memory in a Uint8Array
- Rotation using bitwise XOR shift
- Line clearing using `copyWithin` + `fill`
- Collision detection by testing memory position
- UI attempts to get out of the way
- Web font is limited to 0-9 so it's super small
- Coded in the browser using `import`
- Deployed with a small build script for `nomodule` support
- Some mangling of touchstart/click (to prevent doubles)
