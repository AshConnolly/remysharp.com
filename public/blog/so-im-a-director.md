# So I'm a director

I've always been interested in making films - and honestly, my ultimate job would be a film director.  Alas, no, this is not what this post is about.

I am now, officially, the director of Left Logic Ltd.  The company formed on the 6th of September 2006.

This is an exciting period for me - but equally as frightening.  We've ([the Wife and I](/about)) got our new flat on the horizon, which means, obviously, a mortgage, and if my business does me well, I will finally leave the 'permanent job' nest...well - one day perhaps!

My next steps, aside from finding new clients (on the off chance - visit [Left Logic](http://leftlogic.com) and get in touch!) the next steps are:

* Find myself an accountant
* Open a business bank account (The Abbey are looking pretty attractive with their 'free for life' scheme)
* Register for corporation tax

I'm having a lot of trouble understanding VAT, or certainly what the point is, for businesses.

From what I understand so far is:

1. I'm registered for VAT, so I charge you VAT on my services, let's say £1,000 of business.
2. I pay the VAT man the VAT I took from you.
3. I buy a product worth £1,000 + VAT.
4. I claim the VAT from that product from the VAT man.

Doesn't this mean the money is just travelling in circles?  One for the accountant me thinks!
