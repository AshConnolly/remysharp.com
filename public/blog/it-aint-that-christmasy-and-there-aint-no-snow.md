# It ain't that Christmasy and there ain't no snow

Year after year, here in the UK, we have the same usual rubbish for Christmas songs.  We had [Mr Blobby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Blobby) as No. 1 back in 1993 and [Bob the Builder](http://www.bobthebuilder.com/ "Bob the Builder") in 2000 even made it the poll position.

Sure, we had a [few serious ones](http://www.ccl4.org/xmasno1.html), but come on, admit it, [Mad World](http://youtube.com/watch?v=FtpY5_HASM8&feature=related) was almost as painful as watching [Robert Palmer dance](http://youtube.com/watch?v=F0U5JfGYx4c).

So, this year, I'm rooting for the alternative.

[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/group/xmaschartattack) are going head to head with the likes of the Spice Girls and Simon Cowell's best offerings.  They're backing Lucky Soul's [Lips Are Unhappy](http://www.last.fm/group/xmaschartattack).

It ain't that Christmasy and there ain't no snow (please ignore the double negative...), but it's a difference, it's an alternative to the usual trash we have to listen to for a Number 1.

It's 40p (for two tracks) and all profits go to [War Child](http://www.warchild.org/).  On top of which, if it knocks down the Goliath institutions, you'll have piece of mind that *you* helped make that difference.

Go buy it.
