A few interesting links I came across this week.

<h2>Ethical Web Principles</h2>

<small>Found on July 12, 2019 at 17:01 pm</small>

<p>I've had this link open in my browser nearly a month after seeing <a href="https://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> posting it. This list makes up the core ethics for working on the web. It's something I feel is worthy of re-reading every week to strengthen the message in my head.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is one web</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web should not cause harm to society</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web must support healthy community and debate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web is for all people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security and privacy are essential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web must enable freedom of expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web must make it possible for people to verify the information they see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web must enhance individuals' control and power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web must be an environmentally sustainable platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web is transparent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web is multi-browser, multi-OS and multi-device</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People should be able to render web content as they want</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply these ethics and you'll build a solid and strong web, <strong>for everyone</strong>.</p>

<h2>Old Typewriter Text Effect</h2>

<small>Found on July 12, 2019 at 13:51 pm</small>

<p>Really nice effect replicating the look of a typewriter. What I particularly like is that it uses monospace as the font and it's a progressive enhancement with JavaScript.</p>

<h2>A short note on HTML5 article, section and hgroup</h2>

<small>Found on July 11, 2019 at 13:15 pm</small>

<p>Bruce outlines (bad-dum-tish) a short and sweet note on how to select a few of the "biggie" HTML elements, specifically: <code>section</code> and <code>hgroup</code> (the short version is: don't use them).</p>
