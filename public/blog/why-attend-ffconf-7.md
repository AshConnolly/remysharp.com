If you've been to ffconf in previous years, you'll seem a common thread of sessions on impressive show of creativity using web technologies. This year is no different.

I'm a child of the 80s and 90s, and when I first saw the [Future Crew](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Crew) demo of [Second Reality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reality), [named as](https://slashdot.org/story/99/12/13/0943241/slashdots-top-10-hacks-of-all-time) one of the "Top 10 Hacks of All Time". So, with that, I've always been fasinated by the people out there making this kind of amazing work with web tech.

This year, we have **ART.JS** which aims to answer: what is creative coding, especially with realtime animations and data visualisation?

With a detailed look at the animation loop, gotchas, tricks like cheap motion blur and glow, sound synthesis, and more. Then you'll watch a live coding session to put in this practice, have fun and create something cool *together*!
