# This is the girl

This is the girl I met in collage.

It was only a short journey to falling in love with her when we met in 1995 to becoming boyfriend and girlfriend in 1996.

We've grow up together, we've worked together, we've made a family together, we've laughed together and we've grieved together. We're stronger together and throughout all those 23 years, she's always inspired me.

This is the girl I fell in love with 23 years ago. This is the girl I still love to this day. And this is the girl I get to share all my life with.

I'm very lucky.
