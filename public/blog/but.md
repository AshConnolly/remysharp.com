# But…

![](/images/but.jpg)

I've always had a curious fascination with the english language, and words and meaning in particular. I think it stems from my early misunderstands and confusion around the damn thing. And probably my own dyslexia. I never understood why the word "woman" needed to have the word "man" as part of it. It seemed unfair…and stupid.

_But_ in an especially interesting one. It's like the word exist entirely to cancel out everything before it. The word _but_ should be defined as something like "the _exact_ opposite of the preposition is true". Or as Jon Snow puts it:

> **Sansa Stark:** They respect you, they really do, but you have to... Why are you laughing?
>
> **Jon Snow:** What did father used to say? Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.

I've read and heard it first hand: I'm not sexists, but…

I'm totally guilty of this, but I didn't _really_ notice until I had kids. I find that I might overreact to a situation and try to apologise to my child. I'd say:

> I'm sorry that I shouted at you, but…

…then I'd catch myself. "But". But…somehow it's their fault? Is that what I want to pass on? It's like I'm faking being sorry.

So I think this is a word I'd like to retire now, certainly retire in the context of apologies. When I see it included after something like "I'm not racist, but—" I'm _always_ going to think the opposite.
