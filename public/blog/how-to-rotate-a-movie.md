# How to rotate a movie

I was recently asked to rotate a video for a friend.  Video rotation is required every now and then (especially when you record using a photo camera and the orientation is wrong).

It's quite simple to achieve if you've got a Mac and [QuickTime Pro](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/ "Apple - QuickTime") (which is dirt cheap).  Here's a quick screencast showing [how to rotate a movie](/images/movie-rotate.mov) (5mb).

It's surprisingly easy, but very well tucked away inside of QuickTime. Here are the steps:

1. Open movie in QuickTime.
2. Window -> Show Movie Properties (<img src="/images/mac_command.gif" height="12" width="12" alt="command" title="command">J)
3. In the track listings select the video track (you'll know because 'Visual Settings' will become available as a tab)
4. Select Visual Settings and from the Flip/Rotate options, rotate in the appropriate direction.

Then just save it, or export it to the format du jour.
