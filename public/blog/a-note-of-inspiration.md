# A note of inspiration

It's my birthday today, and a card from my mother gave me a boost of inspiration.  I'm not one to fall for that Hallmark crap, but seeing as [my business](http://leftlogic.com) also had it's birthday, the message felt encouraging:

> Shoot for the moon.  Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars... (Unknown)
