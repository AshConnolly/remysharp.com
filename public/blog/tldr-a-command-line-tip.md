# tldr: a command line tip

Happy weekend: I wanted to share this pretty neat command line tool I came
across very recently. This weekend I shared this tip with the individuals who
bought my [terminal.training](https://terminal.training/) (30% off this cyber
weekend only!).

This is both a command line tool and a web service that gives you a "too long:
didn't read" version of a man(ual) page. And frankly, who's reading man pages
anyway? Not me, I live by the seat of my pants!

Here's an example on the curl command:

What's really cool is that if docs are missing, you can contribute yourself
(here's the source to the output above).

I've even gone ahead an aliased `tldr` to help using `alias help="tldr"`, so now
I can type "help curl" in the command line ðŸ’ª

My [terminal.training](https://terminal.training) also offers a free 5 part mini
course if you want a few extra command line tips.
