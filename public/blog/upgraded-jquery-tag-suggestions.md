# Upgraded jQuery Tag Suggestions

After lots of great feedback, I've upgraded the [jQuery Tag Suggest Plugin](/2007/12/28/jquery-tag-suggestion/).

This post covers the fixes and upgrades.

## Fixes

1. [Clicking between suggestions](http://plugins.jquery.com/node/1520)
2. [Mixed case tags confusing suggestions](/2007/12/28/jquery-tag-suggestion/#comment-51767)
3. Subtle bug when deleting suggestions in the input field

## Upgrades

1. Patched in separator option ([via](/2007/12/28/jquery-tag-suggestion/#comment-51888) - cheers [Brian](http://weblogs.manas.com.ar/bcardiff/))
2. Added filtering to prevent already selected tags appearing in the suggestions

If you have any further feedback or suggestion that can make the tagging plugin better, please drop me a comment.
