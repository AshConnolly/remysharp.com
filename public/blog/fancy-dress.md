# Fancy Dress?

You expect fancy dress parties to be like all those movies you watched when you were young: perfectly designed, quality look and quality fit.

Why is it then that when I try to find an 80s suit to go as [Sonny Crockett](http://imdb.com/gallery/mptv/1368/Mptv/1368/5354_0058.jpg.html?path=gallery&path_key=0086759) from [Miami Vice](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086759/) am I presented with an array of flares, lavender suits and bad material - and not a single shoulder pad in sight!

I remember watch the [Karate Kid](http://imdb.com/title/tt0087538/) when I was young, and the scene with the kids dressed for Halloween come out in those skeleton outfits looked pretty cool to a 7 year old kid. 

So now, in my late 20s, why can't I find anything near as good?  Sure, back when I was 9 a plastic bin bag and some acrylic paint (I think) did the job, but nowadays I want to look the part.

Am I missing something?  Does America just have really authentic fancy dress stores, or is England shockingly bad at fancy dress, or was I simply duped when I was younger, and the movie studios designed those outfits for the film?
