# A self destructive web

I'm finding myself more and more nowadays interested in content that [self destructs](https://twitter.com/rem/status/392601422480805888), or rather: expires after time and will no longer exist.

This post is more *me dropping my thoughts on a page* rather than having fully explored the idea (yet). Please note this post is also unedited (which I may use to my advantage and edit over time...we'll see).

## Saving is "forever"?

From an early age I've played and worked with computers. I always understood that I was creating programs that would be **saved**.

That simple idea of saving, be it to a physical tape (I was a Spectrum user) or fast forward to the 90s when I published my first web pages - it was simply naughts and ones and since it was stored digitally&dagger;, it could be copied over and over. When it was on a server, all it needed is the server to stay plugged in or even cached on another server and boom, you've just unlocked *forever*.

<small>&dagger; Sure, the tape drive wasn't digital, but you'll forgive me.</small>

But the simple fact is: we have to make an effort to preserve. Server drives crash, data gets lost, companies disappear (my first site was on lineone.net if anyone remember that - now long gone), domains expire and people die.

So what is *forever*? Maybe there's an unspoken expiry? But when the expiry is in decades I feel like I conflate this with forever. I don't feel like the web community has been going long enough to see that long expiry showing it's face. Maybe we've got another 20-30 years to go.

## Should it last forever?

I *was* just looking at [Stef Lewandowski's](http://twitter.com/stef) tweet about their new hack [Linkydin](http://writing.makeshift.io/pieces/introducing-linkydink). A nice idea, but I was asking myself: surely these links have context in *time*.

If you're sharing a group of links in a team, should that information expire? What good is it a year (or more) later to new team members, and in fact could it share old and busted knowledge that's been superceeded by better information? *I don't know*.

Then I read [Paul Neave's](http://twitter.com/neave) post ["Why I create for the web"](http://blog.neave.com/post/64669185529/why-i-create-for-the-web) and he boils it down to the humble hyperlink. Except the way I *found* his post was through a tweet. A tweet that a) I will unlikely find again (because twitter's archive search is limited) and b) goes *through* twitter's own link shortening service. If that service is shut down, then that hyperlink is sent to the grave (note that this isn't the point of @neave's post - but it got me thinking).

I recently looked at Snapchat. Content that purposely destroys itself, I can only assume, because it's relevant for that moment &dagger;. I also remember someone having a blog that would slowly remove all the blog posts one at a time over a period of time (and it would look like the articles were fading out at the bottom of the site).

<small>&dagger; Though Snapchat might [not destroy the data on the phone](http://blog.snapchat.com/post/50060403002/how-snaps-are-stored-and-deleted) it is actually removed from their server, which, to me, means it'll expire from existence *somehow* eventually.</small>

I like these later two because they've thought specifically about time and how it should be addressed. My own blog, I haven't thought about time. I haven't thought about whether it'll shutdown after I die. I've long stopped posting to [jQuery for Designers](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/) but I'll keep the domain renewed...but for how long? 

**Should sites be retired to the archive.org?**

I don't know. A lot of these questions are why I've asked Jeremy Keith to [speak at Full Frontal](http://2013.full-frontal.org/#time) whereby he chose the title "Time". I expect he'll add a lot of clarity to some of my thoughts, but no doubt raise a good deal of new questions.

## Everything ends

Everything has an expiry. Nothing lasts forever, but maybe my expectations need to adjust on the web. If something lasts a few years on the web that's a good thing. If I can get my data out of a web service, then that's a good thing too (because I'm now responsible for my content, like photos which I care about).

I'm just very interested in seeing more services taking advantage of expiry as a feature. Heck, we buy and own (small) pets because the expiry is a feature! Why don't we use this more on the web?
