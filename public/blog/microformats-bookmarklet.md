# Microformats Bookmarklet

If you're at all familiar with [Microformats](http://microformats.org), or even just a vCard, then you may well be interested in the bookmarklet I've written.  If not - get reading - interesting stuff (I'm also planning to convert my film reviews to [hReviews](http://microformats.org/wiki/hReview)).  

It allows the user to load an overlaid window on the current page and download and import vCards or iCal items individually.

By the way, if you don't know what a bookmarklet is here it is in a nutshell:

> A bookmarklet is a small JavaScript program that can be stored as a URL within a bookmark in most popular web browsers, or within hyperlinks on a web page.
