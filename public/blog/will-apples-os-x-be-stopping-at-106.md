# Will Apple's OS X be stopping at 10.6?

Being a bit of a Mac fan, I casually mentioned to my wife the upcoming (and generally eagerly awaited) [Macworld conference](http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/events/20SFO07A/keynotes).  I then went on to mention that I'll be buying [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/index.html) when it comes out.

[Julie's](https://flickr.com/photos/remysharp/267986595/) response: Didn't you buy it last year?

Me: No, that was Tiger.

Julie: How many big cats are there?

Good point!

Leopard is due out this spring, so I popped over to [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.com) to see what big cats had been used by Apple so far:

1. Mac OS X 10.0 - Cheetah
2. Mac OS X 10.1 - Puma
3. Mac OS X 10.2 - Jaguar
4. Mac OS X 10.3 - Panther
5. Mac OS X 10.4 - Tiger
6. Mac OS X 10.5 - Leopard

[<img width="400" src="/images/OSXBoxes.png" alt="Box artwork for Mac OS X versions Cheetah/Puma, Jaguar, Panther, and Tiger" title="Box artwork for Mac OS X versions Cheetah/Puma, Jaguar, Panther, and Tiger" />](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osx)

By my reckoning (and little more Wikipedia browsing), the only [big cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_cat) left is the Lion.

There are others: the Snow Leopard and Clouded Leopard - but I ruled them out because, well, we're going have Leopard this year...and we don't want to repeat do we?

There's also an [Onza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onza), but a) I'm not sure very many people will realise this is (supposed to be) classed as a big cat, and b)
> Texas Tech University researchers concluded that the onza is most likely a genetic variant of puma, but not a distinct cat species

*Source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onza)*

So, all in all it sounds like Lion should be next, and then...what?  The end of OS X?  The end of big kitty codenames?

> What do you mean there's no more big cats left?  What did you think we would do a "[Microsoft Word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms_word#Versions)" and just make the numbers up? *

<small>* i.e. MS Word 1, 2, 6, 7, 8...etc.</small>

Either way - I'm looking forward to what Apple can pull out of the bag.

<small>Oh, and just to cover myself here, obviously this is all a bit tongue in cheek! :-)</small>
