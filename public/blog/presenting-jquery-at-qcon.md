# Presenting jQuery at QCon

Last year I attended my [first conference](http://twitter.com/rem/statuses/252197402), d'Construct 07, and this year, I'm speaking at my first conference.

I was asked if I could do a talk on jQuery for the [QCon conference](http://jaoo.dk:80/london-2008/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=100) going on this week, which is where I'll be [tomorrow](http://jaoo.dk:80/london-2008/presentation/The+DOM+scripting+toolkit%3A+jQuery).  It's an hour long, and it'll be the first time I speak in front of the general tech public (rather than to other teams within your company)

The presentation aims to take the audience through jQuery from top to bottom, running through examples and some of the lesser known/exploited features of jQuery (though I don't think there's many).

I'll be posting up the slides to the presentation early next week, and I hope to also include a transcript (or a rough version of it) so that you might have some kind of commentary to go with the slides.

The post will also include links to the demos that I include and any instructions with them.

Wish me <del>luck</del> - nothing, I should be prepared enough, and if I've not, what's the worst that could happen!
