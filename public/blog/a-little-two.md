# A little two

<!--more-->

![Seren, 2](https://remysharp.com/images/seren-two.jpg)

Today our littlest turns two. Seren has such a huge personality, leaping, bounding, tumbling, and always chasing after her brother!

Seren, here, was opening presents and really getting into it: unwrapping the gifts and exclaiming "mine" (just starting to speak), particular poignant as most of the toys she plays with belong to her older brother.

Happy birthday, my love ‚ù§
