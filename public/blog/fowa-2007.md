# FOWA 2007

I'm off to the [Future of Web Apps](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/ "The Future of Web Apps - Web 2.0 Conference and Expo") and following on from [dConstruct](http://2007.dconstruct.org/ "dConstruct 2007: User Experience Design Conference"), I have high expectations.

I've looked through the line up, and I'm 99% certain that I'll be spending all my time watching the developer's floor - [some pretty interesting stuff](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/schedule.html) (which I hope to write a few notes up later on in the week).

The sessions that I'm most interested in hearing are:

* High Performance Websites - Steve Souders (Yahoo!)
* The Future of Firefox and JavaScript - John Resig (Mozilla Corporation)
* Comet: Making the Web a 2-Way Medium - Joe Walker (DWR)
* An Insight to FireEagle - Tom Coates (Yahoo!) 

That said, I can say I'm keen to hear all the sessions over the two conference, and no doubt that I'll be laying my dirty little mitts on all the freebies I can get (and missing my wife those lonely days that I'm away from home)!

There's also [Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation/) being filmed live on the Wednesday, which will be interesting to see - I'm not one of those that go droopy over Kevin Rose, and in honesty it'll be the first Diggnation I'll have actually seen.

Then straight after there's a shin dig (erhem - pardon the pun), which mixed with free booze, sounds like a good way to get over the mid-week hump.
