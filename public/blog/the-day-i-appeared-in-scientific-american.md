# The day I appeared in Scientific American

<img style="float: right; padding: 0 0 5px 5px;" src="/images/scientific_american.gif" alt="Scientific American" /> Several years ago I wrote [Marbles Squared](http://www.ihatemusic.com/palm/ihm_marbles.html), a 'lightweight addictive puzzle game' for the [Palm Pilot](http://euro.palm.com/uk/en/products/palmvx/index.html).

I would often peruse [Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22marbles+squared%22) for reviews and download figures, until one day, I found an [article](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000970C9-65AC-1150-A5AC83414B7F0000&pageNumber=2&catID=2) that referenced my little game.

Somehow, randomly, some chap was writing for the [Scientific American](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000970C9-65AC-1150-A5AC83414B7F0000&pageNumber=2&catID=2) about Palm Pilots, and he had spotting some kid on the tube (or subway for those across the pond) playing the same game he was playing: Marbles Squared:

> She was just jealous, I thought. After all, she was a mere BlackBerry user, whereas I was a member of the digerati! To console myself, I downloaded a game called [Marbles Squared](http://www.ihatemusic.com/palm/ihm_marbles.html) to my Treo. It was good for playing on the subway, where I couldn't connect to the Web. But one morning on the downtown local, I looked up from my screen and saw that the person sitting next to me was playing the same game on his Treo. He was a pimply teenager with peach fuzz on his upper lip. So much for my delusions of technological grandeur.

I didn't realise that the magazine was actually *a magazine* - one you could pick up and read!  I just thought it was some little nothing comment on the net.  I had to have it pointed out earlier this year that, in fact, it was pretty cool to be mention in the article.
