# Shameless

I had the pleasure of working with Cancer Research this year in building the backend and front end interactive technology behind their [TacheBack](http://www.tacheback.com/tacehwars) campaign.

Now the web site is up for the [Yahoo People's Choice Awards](http://uk.promotions.yahoo.com/finds2007/peoples-choice/) - so I'm asking that you take a peruse and place your vote.
