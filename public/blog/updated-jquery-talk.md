# Updated jQuery Talk

I was asked to share my knowledge at [SkillSwap](http://skillswap-brighton.org/ "SkillSwap Brighton") which was great evening (it's certainly encouraged me out of [my little box](http://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/2324926736/in/set-72157600666145464/) and head to [future events](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/535879/)) ([thanks also to  John](http://remysharp.com/2008/03/13/presenting-jquery-at-qcon/#comment-54923)).

The slides were updated for SkillSwap, and then also for the ThoughtWorks talk I gave, and in addition, I've recorded screencasts for each of the demos.

## Screencasts

The screencast runs all as one, and runs for 15 minutes.  They're branded as [jQuery for Designers](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/ "jQuery for Designers - Tutorials and screencasts"), but it was so they still had the Creative Commons license on them.
