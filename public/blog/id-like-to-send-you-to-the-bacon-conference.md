# I'd like to send you to the Bacon conference

The folks at Mint Digital made this video (below) to convince me to send my devs to [Bacon](http://devslovebacon.com/) - the developer conference. Unfortunately none of us can make it. I'll admit that I'd really like to go along, so this kind of sucks.

But! Instead, as a nice thing&trade;, I'd like to send one of you.

<div class="update">And the <a href="http://goo.gl/2Hjhw">randomly selected</a> person is&hellip;<a href="http://twitter.com/rsolomou">Rich Solomou</a> (submitted by email by Rich Boakes). I'll be in touch, and get that ticket for you - congratulations, and thanks everyone for participating!</div>

I'd like to send someone who's new to the web industry and wouldn't normally be able to afford this kind of conference.

I'll foot the bill for your ticket (Tom's discount will go towards it too) but you'll need to arrange your own travel and any necessary lodgings.

I'll pick someone at random on **Wednesday 27th at 12pm**.

So please volunteer yourself, or even volunteer someone you know that you think is deserving. I will be on the look out for things like your blog, any git repo - that all counts towards whether you make it in the hat. Pop a comment below (or [contact me directly](http://leftlogic.com/contact?subject=Re: Bacon)) with your name and why you should go, and I'll start adding names to my hat to later pull one lucky candidate of out.

And you never know, you might even discover your next big client or employer at the conference!
