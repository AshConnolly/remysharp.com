# A Side View: front end dev conference

As the curator of [Full Frontal](http://2013.full-frontal.org) I'm extremely proud of our event and it's content, and this year we sold out in 11 minutes. 

That was good *and* bad. The bad being that lots of people missed out.

So I'm running a side event called: Side View on Saturday 9th November in Brighton, UK.

It's 6 front end sessions for Â£50+VAT. Frankly I think it's a steal, but then I get to go free (because I'm running it!).

Full details of each talk and the link to buy tickets is here:

I'd love for you to come along, and equally if you can spread the word that would really help. Full Frontal sells out quickly, but getting the word out about a new event is always harder.

Also, we're still looking for a single sponsor for the event who would get exclusive rights over sponsorship. If you're interested (or know a company) please get in touch (a contact link is on the page above).

Thanks, and please do spread the word!
