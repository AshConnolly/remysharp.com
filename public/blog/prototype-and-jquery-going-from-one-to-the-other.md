# Prototype and jQuery - going from one to the other

During a conversion with [John Resig](http://ejohn.org) at the [FOWA](http://futureofwebapps.com/ "The Future of Web Apps - Web 2.0 Conference and Expo") he mentioned it would be useful to have a tutorial that explained what jQuery doesn't do that Prototype does and visa versa, and in particular how X process is done in each library.

Below you can find the presentation I put together that goes through the core of both libraries and gives you a process by process comparison, explaining how to achieve each function in each library.

## [Prototype & jQuery](http://www.slideshare.net/remy.sharp/prototype-jquery-going-from-one-to-the-other)

You can also download the [Prototype &amp; jQuery slides](http://www.slideshare.net/remy.sharp/prototype-jquery-going-from-one-to-the-other/download) ([mirror](http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/prototype-and-jquery.pdf))

The slides should pretty much talk for themselves, but I welcome any feedback or questions you may have.
