# 2007 Moments

In lieu of more technical posts, I thought I'd put down my thoughts on *my* 2007.  I'd love to hear yours.

Happy new year!

## Firsts

[London to Brighton](http://remysharp.com/2007/06/19/our-london-to-brighton-bike-ride-and-route/).  I moved (back) down to Brighton about 3 years ago now, and it was the first time that I rode the London to Brighton.  It took a grand 7 hours, mostly due to congestion, but it's spurred us both on to want to the do the London to Paris in 2008 for charity.

## Tech Goodness

Falling over on the way to work, cracking a rib and [totalling my laptop](http://remysharp.com/2006/12/14/the-delicate-apple/), which resulted in a [brand spanking new](http://remysharp.com/2006/12/21/the-delicate-apple-part-2/) MacBook Pro.

## Projects of 2007

I'm somewhat obsessed with creating new stuff, and most of the time they'll be web projects.  Here's a short list of highlights:

* [jQuery for Designers](http://jqueryfordesigners.com) - fortnightly articles detailing how to implement JavaScript goodness in to web sites.
* [HTML entity](http://leftlogic.com/lounge/articles/entity-lookup/) - lookup tool available as a widget, online tool, search plugin, Firefox plugin and AIR widget.  Saves you looking through 200 odd HTML entities and finds the entity based on how it looks.
* Conquering [OpenID as a log in system](http://remysharp.com/2007/12/21/how-to-integrate-openid-as-your-login-system/) - I'd love to re-work all the site I work on to use it, but alas, there's so little time and often not the budget (to back-engineer it in - there's always the budget to plan it in in the first place).
* [Todged](http://todged.com/) - my unfinished code repository.  Supports OpenID logins and avatar detection along with a host of other jQuery snippets behind the scenes. I'm aiming to be at a decent beta stage Q1 2008 which should cover most of the [roadmap](http://todged.com/roadmap).


## Best films I saw

[300](http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/) and [StarDust](http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/stardust/) - I went to see both films expecting a lot, and both delivered, I felt, at the highest level.

I also (finally) saw [Am√©lie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/), after much hype from [Andy Boyd](http://flickr.com/photos/remysharp/233636019/in/photostream/) and my wife, and found it to be worth the wait.  It didn't blow my mind, but it's definitely one I'll be watching again.

## Looking ahead

The biggest/exciting challenges I've got ahead of me for 2008 are, physically: riding the London to Paris, mentally: turning 30, emotionally: spending another great year happily married to [my wife](http://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/2151045633/).

Finally, in the spirit of not being able to sit comfortably, I'm going to re-skin my blog ([again](http://remysharp.com/2007/07/22/what-to-expect-next/)), I want something really simple, and wide enough to hold code examples (this current scheme is too narrow) and a small selection of sidebar widgets (like popular posts).  I like all the widgets I've got going, but sometimes feel they're a bit much that aren't looked at that much!  Suggestions would be welcomed!

## Posts coming up

I thought it might also be a good time to offer a heads up to some of the upcoming posts for 2008:

* Ajax pattern for form validation (following on from [using Ajax to validate forms](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/using-ajax-to-validate-forms/))
* Avatar detection - whilst making the user think they haven't given any details
* Freebase implementation howto
* Poor man's JavaScript behaviours
