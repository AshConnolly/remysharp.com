# T-Mobile allow free Wifi Google Maps

This is an odd one, but while I was out in [Berlin](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=park+inn+hotel,+Berlin&ie=UTF8&ll=52.52258,13.411388&spn=0.008225,0.021994&t=h&z=16&om=1), where there was pay for T-Mobile, I found that I could access [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/ "Google Maps") via the iPod [Maps app](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#map) without having to pay any connection fee.

I'm fairly sure it was due to: allowing users to pay for Internet access, T-Mobile (and other WiFi providers) will allow some very specific pages to go through their access rules.

As such, though I couldn't find them, I'm sure that they must have had Google Maps somewhere in their *open* site perhaps by way of 'contact us', thus they're allowing the IPs that serve up the Google mapping content.

Equally, if I tried to visit [http://maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com/ "Google Maps") it wouldn't allow me to access the page.  However, searching maps directly in the Maps app **would** allow me to search.

Two things you might be asking yourself:

1. If you've got the maps app, surely you can just visit it via edge, since it comes on the iPhone?  Nope, I've, ::erhem:: [tweaked my iPod Touch](http://www.touchdev.net/wiki/Jailbreak_1.1.2) to give me maps and mail.
2. Sadly, I've found this nice little hack *doesn't* work in the UK.

It would be great to know whether any other countries support this hack, if you happen to have an iPod Touch or iPhone and near a T-Mobile connection point!
