# Google says 'no'

I was browsing around the net looking for something when Google, the true key holder to all doorways, presented me with a page I'd never seen before!

![Google says no!](http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/google_says_no.gif)

Now, clearly I was looking for something I shouldn't be (kudos to anyone who comments and guesses right!), but I thought that [Google were on censoring China's content](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4645596.stm) but I didn't realise that they would stop a lowly Englishman traversing cyberspace.

By the way, since I'm driving a Mac, I figured I was invincible and threw caution to the wind by visiting the web site.  Turned out they didn't have the stuff I needed!

If anyone else has seen this, maybe we should start a list of 'no-no' words!
