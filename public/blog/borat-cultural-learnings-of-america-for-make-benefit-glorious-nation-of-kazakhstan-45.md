# Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (4/5*)

I hadn't seen [Borat][borat] before, but I knew of him.  I saw [Ali G Indahouse](http://imdb.com/title/tt0284837/) and hadn't seen the TV show and loved it (it's a great hang over film).

Borat is sent away to report back to Kazakhstan about the greatest country in the World: USA.  Somewhere along the way he loses his heart to [Pamela Anderson](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000097/).

It does end with a little meaning, but beyond that, it is just Borat travelling across America meeting Americans and showing up both cultural divides, but also the small-mindedness that can be so easily found.

The film **is** wall-to-wall laughs, even if some of them nervous laughs from *that* scene that will spawn the line:

> My moustache still tastes of your testes!

Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

Directed by: [Larry Charles](http://imdb.com/name/nm0153078/)

It's a laugh out loud comedy, but amidst the realms of [Jackass](http://imdb.com/title/tt0322802/).

[Sacha Baron Cohen](http://imdb.com/name/nm0056187/) gives a flawless performance of Borat leaving you wondering whether any of it was staged and whether Pamela Anderson *really* did go through that!
