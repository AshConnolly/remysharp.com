# Gravatar - bit of a bad start

I came across [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) about a year ago and signed up - since it was free and the blog I was commenting on support it.  Nice idea.

Today I logged in and decided for 10 of your US bucks, I could add extra email addresses (which was something I wanted to do).  $10 a year.  That's not much, so I paid up.  

Unfortunately, that's when it all went wrong.

Really all I wanted to do was use a different email address.  I could have signed up again, but I felt it was a good enough idea (by the chap who runs Gravatar), that I should cough up the cash.

Sadly, when ever I tried to add my extra email address I would get an 'application error' from [Ruby](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) (nice to see a Ruby app though).

When I tried to upload a different photo it would simply hang and timeout (perhaps it was a pre-emptive blocking of my mug!).  I did manage to add a new picture by uploading to my own servers and pointing to it like that - but none the less...

<img style="float: right; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; height: 150px;" title="Gravatar live cropping" src="http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/gravatar_live_cropping.jpg" /> 
The cropping tool was very nice - and it was nice to see it was just via JavaScript.

Ultimately though, I had just paid for the service, I thought I could submit the bug.  Oh no.

The help wasn't implemented.  There wasn't a contact form.  I checked the blog - but there didn't seem to be any way to add any comments, and when I visited the developer's home page it was "dead" (up, but retired) and the site it redirected me to was down.  

Not a great start.

All that said, I still think it's a great idea and I am planning to implement it in to this blog, and some of my [other projects](http://kajinka.com) when I get the chance.
