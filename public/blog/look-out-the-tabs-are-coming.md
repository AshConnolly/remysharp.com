# Look out, the tabs are coming

Steve Jobs announced Leopard will be available in spring 2007 and then handed out developer pre-release OS 10.5 to the developers attending the <abbr title="World Wide Developers Conference">WWDC</abbr>.

This has then spawned a number of preview sites ([quickly getting nailed by Apple](http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=268)), and a number of videos on [You Tube](http://youtube.com).

One thing I've noticed are is the tabs are coming!â€ 

<small>â€  Sorry if someone else noticed this ages ago :-|</small>

From some of the videos released on [You Tube](http://youtube.com) you can see that tabs are being integrated in to more apps (okay, maybe just Finder) in a consistent manner:

* [Safari and better tab integration](http://youtube.com/watch?v=j2WY3inouhw)
* [Tabs in Finder](http://youtube.com/watch?v=M3pdxJ_mKII)
* [Another tabs in Finder](http://youtube.com/watch?v=hC5ahdZe7Yo)

Check out the cool effect of dragging a tab from out of the tab bar.
