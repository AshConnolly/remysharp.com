# Win a ticket for the Full Frontal JavaScript Conference

I recently released [a way to enter to win a ticket](https://twitter.com/fullfrontalconf/status/3226112563) for [Full Frontal](http://full-frontal.org), but I'm particularly guilty of only sending things through [Twitter](http://twitter.com) lately, and I know [not everyone uses Twitter](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/html-5-doctor-sitepoint-article/) (see dull meta), so I need to make sure I'm not ignoring my *regular* readers: you!

## Free ticket or reimbursed ticket

I've never been sure whether to enter these competitions when I had already bought a ticket, so I figured I may as well make *my* competition the kind that I would enter.

If you've already got a ticket, and you win, we'll give you a full reimbursement.  If you don't have a ticket, we'll give you one for free.

So, you can [get your Full Frontal ticket](http://www.stubmatic.com/leftlogic/) now, and *still* enter :-)

## How to win a free ticket

We're drawing two winners for free tickets on *Tuesday 1st September* and *Monday 2nd November*, and announcing the winners via [@fullfrontalconf](http://twitter.com/fullfrontalconf).

Head over to the [Full Frontal](http://full-frontal.org) web site, and read the [ticket draw](http://2009.full-frontal.org/ticket-draw) details.

Pop the Full Frontal banner on your blog, and that's it.  You can see an example of the banner on my sidebar to the right of my site.

If you have any questions, get in touch, otherwise: Good luck!
