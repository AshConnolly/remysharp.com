# Ethos

This just a page for things that I've collected over time. Usually it's sometime that someone else has said, but calls to me. It rings true to my ethos and existence.

It's far from definitive and not organised well, but it's a start to capture what I believe in. *This is a continuous work in progress.* And no, I don't care if you disagree with anything on this page. It's for me.

## Find the right path for *ourselves*

This is such a good speech on having the right to choose your own path.
