# Ethos

This just a page for things that I've collected over time. Usually it's sometime that someone else has said, but calls to me. It rings true to my ethos and existence.

It's far from definitive and not organised well, but it's a start to capture what I believe in. *This is a continuous work in progress.* And no, I don't care if you disagree with anything on this page. It's for me.

## Being inspired to speak up

I've [written before](/2014/10/27/motivation) about how Emma Watson's UN address inspired me. I'll be showing my son & daughter this talk when they're old enough to understand.

I love this representation of how biased systems work, and how my neutral position would indeed *not* be neutral â€” [Via twitter](https://twitter.com/danielsolis/status/707663012606246913) 9 Mar 2016

## Royce Mann, Age 14, "White Boy Privilege", Slam Poem

I could *wish* I had this much insight when I was 14. Instead, I'm learning from this kid and aim to pass this message on to my white privileged children.

### How to be perfectly unhappy

> But those feelings are ephemeral. Being "happy" implies permanence. It implies you completed all the prerequisites. And now you get to sit atop your giant pile of happy forever.

This comic, somehow describes exactly how I've always felt about being "happy". I've never been able to say, truthfully, that I was happy. I found this <time datetime="2016-10-07 18:00:00">today</time> and it says what I've never been able to articulate.

## All that we share

In a time where higher powers are trying to convince us that we should be afraid of each other, this advert (of all things) is a beautiful remind of all that we share.
