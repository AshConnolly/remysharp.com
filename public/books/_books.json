    "review": "I loved the concept behind this story. Firemen: those who burnt books. The story does go into why this profession even exists and it's even more intriguing.<br /><br />But I really struggled with the book. It's a little over 100 pages and I felt like I was slogging the book after the first 1/4 of the story. I _think_ the writing style also distracted me from the story too. I felt line nearly every sentence was laiden with a turn of phrase or clever simile - but the book is *thick* with this and it became very noticeable to the point of distraction.<br /><br />The pace really threw me off too, it starts building up characters and before I know it, Montag is murdering his fire chief, battling murderous robot dogs, planting fake evidence against another fireman (and from what I could tell, a character we hadn't met) and then wondering off in the woods to meet the people who keep books in their heads.<br /><br />It felt like there was a great story of a dystopia where happiness is swallowed up in a pill, potentially like Brave New World, but Fahrenheit 451, for me, falls way short of achieving that.<br /><br />A shame. I really wanted to enjoy this story more.",

    "review": "My rating is based on how much I _personally enjoyed_ the story. It was pretty heavy reading, and perhaps more so as I knew there was an underlying bullying aspect that ran through the story - and bullying always puts me on edge.<br /><br />The book itself is brilliantly written and the climax of the story is masterfully executed. Golding does an excellent job of slowly building up the tension throughout the story until it's crashing so hard at the end of the story it seems like there's no way out.<br /><br />Ralph's (one of the protagonists) feeling of peril at the end of the book is visceral. Reminding me of my typical nightmares and stress dreams where I'm unable to escape the terror no matter what choice I make.<br /><br />Stressful, but solid, reading.",

At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable tale about ‚Äúthe end of innocence, the darkness of man‚Äôs heart.‚Äù"

    "review": "Absolutely superb stuff. This book was recommended separately by three different friends, and it lived up to expectations. <br /><br />It's the first fantasy book I've read (or certainly in the last decade) so initially I wasn't quite sure. As the chapters progressed though, the story fell into really beautiful story telling.<br /><br />I'm was taken away by how good the writing and prose were. There were turns of phases that were fun and a pleasure to read. The book itself is also broken into small enough chapters that I could read for 15-20 minutes at night and complete a chapter (I like to stop reading at \"natural\" endings).<br /><br />The story, or rather the trilogy of books (this being book 1), follows Kvothe and the telling of his life story. Kvothe agrees to tell his story over three days (at which point I realised that I was reading Day 1). <br /><br />I'd to write more of thorough review, but the story is brilliantly dense that I can't do it justice. The second book in the trilogy is 1,000 pages - which is daunting to me, but it's definitely on my reading list now. There's also a number of novellas that have been written for the world the Rothfuss has written which I've also earmarked. As for the conclusion of the trilogy, I've been told that not only is there no publication date set, but that Rothfuss has been at it for 8 years üò±!!!",

The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature. A high-action story written with a poet's hand, <i>The Name of the Wind</i> is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard."

Somehow I personally experienced a similar sleeping pattern (sticking to a regular alarm, getting up quickly, getting sunlight) and it worked incredibly well for me for 2 years (until I broke the pattern).<br /><br />The body of the book though is littered with how the author works with top sports teams, Manchester United, Man City, Arsenal, etc - top cyclists etc. I was happily convinced of his authority by chapter 1, but I didn't need repeated on every chapter. It felt like random name dropping (since most of the sports celebrities named were unknown to me).<br /><br />All in all, there are some useful tips throughout the book, but probably didn't need so much of the constant reminders of who the author worked with.",

    "review": "I wanted to love this book but I kinda fell short right at the end. However, the two protagonists: Patricia and Lawrence are beautifully written.<br /><br />The book is split over 3 era's of our characters' lives. Firstly when they're young children where the world is huge and wonderous. Patricia in particular has her first adventure very early in the book, and in part I wondered if this was entirely in a child's imagination rather than happening to her.<br /><br />The next era in the book Patricia and Lawrence are at (what I'd consider 'middle school'), and frankly it's horrible. They're bullied and targeted across the board. I found this part of the book the hardest hitting, and probably closer to the reality I know and it made me sad for the characters. I also felt like there was no real growth from this period of the book and they were simply tortured for being different and that wasn't addressed (or I missed it).<br /><br />Then the last era of the book the characters are young adults, Patricia a witch with more control over her powers (and yes, it seems that it wasn't her imagination back when she was a child), and Lawrence a full super nerd building a machine to save humanity. <br /><br />The story feels like it accelerates in momentum, complexity and consequence as it progresses. It reads really well, and the sci-fi aspects are fun, complex and draw some interesting moral questions.<br /><br />Except for me, the end just‚Ä¶kinda happened. I was following the story along, the world in the book was going to hell, level 10 dystopia stuff, and then all of a sudden the protagonists left alone, Patricia is following a pigeon to a tree, they have a weird conversation, she vaguely answers a question and then Patricia and Lawrence walk off together into the sunset (sort of) with a sense of hope and everything will be okay for them.<br /><br />Yet the world is still collapsing (mother nature trying to course correct), witches (and wizards?) are blasting people into unknown realms, and intend to unleash The Unravelling (which we meet once and it's a horror show), and the scientists are pissed and building mega machines to blow away the witches. So that's all still happening and yet Patricia and Lawrence seem to be okay.<br /><br />I was left feeling like I missed something crucial at the end of the book, because I felt like the characters were doom, but didn't realise it, and the world was going to die even though both Patricia and Lawrence intended to save it. So‚Ä¶yeah, I'm not sure.<br /><br />I loved the characters, and the writing was great and really original, and quite biting at times. But the more I thought about the end of the story, the more confused I felt.",

    "review": "I've read and enjoyed the previous two Clement stories. This story was fun, and a very easy read (for me to get through 400 pages in a matter of days is testament to that).<br /><br />The story follows a journalist, Emma in her mid-40s, living in London on her own and being handed crappy assignments, whilst she's still hungry for her big break.<br /><br />She comes across Clement (our 70s angel trying to - somehow - find redemption) and he's drawn to her knowing that he must help her in some way. Enter the Clawthorn Club and the story.<br /><br />Overall, the story is enjoyable, and it's nice to get a little into the feelings of Clement (having read the two previous installments). The story does have some predictable (to me) twists, but it doesn't hurt the reading experience too much.<br /><br />Sadly the author decided this was the book to push his own opinions about the current climate of how women are to take daily microaggressions. <br /><br />I understand that Clement's language and attitudes stem from the 60s and 70s which leads to some socially jarring language. This is what adds to Clement's charm, that when he's pulled up on the language be it \"casual\" racism or sexism he listens to the feedback and adjusts when appropriate. <br /><br />This book is different to the previous installments, as this story is sprinkled with the protagonist, Emma, casually putting down other women's own struggles. These times throughout the book don't contribute to the characters nor did it help the story along, so I sense this is more that the author is _shoehorning_ their own opinions in. Which served to annoy and frustrate me when I bumped into those random moments in the book.",

    "review": "Goodness me, this was a good book! Right from the start, Rutherford states that the book won't be littered with references to research papers throughout and the book reads very much like Rutherford is quite literally telling me _a story_ (I should add that references are added in the appendix of the book if you want to validate and have further reading on the subject of DNA).<br /><br />I always feel like when I read non-fiction I'm supposed to be a little smarter once I've finished, and somehow retain my newly acquired knowledge so I can wax lyrical later on in the pub in years to come‚Ä¶<br /><br />The subject of this book is (as the title suggest) genes, DNA and how it all works. The book is fascinating, and although I'm certain that I'm zero percent smarter now (sadly my own failing!), Rutherford's book was littered with fascinating stories from both recent and distant history - which have so far stuck in my head.<br /><br />I got wind of this book via my own genealogy research, and being able to find every step in my ancestry to William The Conqueror, I posted a tweet and eventually saw a reply from Adam Rutherford explaining \"that's cool that you can demonstrate it with genealogy, but it‚Äôs literally true for all British people too. Edward 3 is the direct ancestor of every British person\". <br /><br />That snippet reply alone piqued my interest in reading this book, and damn glad I did - I think I highlighted nearly two pages worth of kindle notes, partly to help me remember and partly because there was some superb stuff in there, including:<br /><br />> borborygmus, which is a technical word for a rumbly tummy.<br /><br />Rutherford's writing and storytelling is entertaining, informative and even regularly funny.",

It is unique to you, as it is to each of the 100 billion modern humans who have ever drawn breath. But it is also our collective story, because in every one of our genomes we each carry the history of our species - births, deaths, disease, war, famine, migration and a lot of sex.<br /><br />Since scientists first read the human genome in 2001 it has been subject to all sorts of claims, counterclaims and myths. In fact, as Adam Rutherford explains, our genomes should be read not as instruction manuals, but as epic poems. DNA determines far less than we have been led to believe about us as individuals, but vastly more about us as a species.<br /><br />In this captivating journey through the expanding landscape of genetics, Adam Rutherford reveals what our genes now tell us about history, and what history tells us about our genes. From Neanderthals to murder, from redheads to race, dead kings to plague, evolution to epigenetics, this is a demystifying and illuminating new portrait of who we are and how we came to be."

But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem.

The planet has been ravished by something that has scrambled DNA across all life, and humanity (as we meet it in the start of the book) is holding dearly onto \"pure\" existence. \"Pure\" being applied to crops, animals and humans, or \"man\". <br /><br />The result of a non-pure human (an extra toe or misshapen bones or perhaps an extra chromosome?) leads to that individual being sent to the \"Fringes\", perhaps even exiled to the Badlands, or just murdered. For intolerance.<br /><br />Except David does not fit in, and the community is ultimately fearful of change and they religiously to stem it's progress. The thing is: life is change.<br /><br />---<br /><br />One of the more poignant moments (to me) was between David and his uncle (who is sympathetic to \"Deviations\"), where his uncle questions the ideas and definitions of \"pure\" and \"pure man\", and how it is horribly flawed. <br /><br />This entire exchange prompted me to consider what we, in <i>our</i> society and <i>our</i> communities accept as written in stone. And perhaps I'd do well to remember that just because something \"is\" doesn't mean it should be.<br /><br />---<br /><br />A character that I struggled a little with, was Sophie. Her character early in the story was strong and inquisitive about the world. When we meet her much later in the story and in life, she knows what she wants, but her wants are limited to the world she now exists in. Specifically she works to protect her position as the raped partner of the head of her tribe. <br /><br />Sophie's character is possibly the most heartbreaking, and I wish she had been able to escape her destiny.<br /><br />Yet, when David, his cousin Rosalind and his sister Petra escape to a new land at the end of the story, the intolerance exists in this new community, though it seems the only difference is that they know that they will be succeeded eventually (and not without putting up a fight).",

      "description": "First published in 1955, <i>The Chrysalids</i> is a post-nuclear story of genetic mutation in a devastated world, which tells of the lengths the intolerant will go to to keep themselves pure.<br /><br />David Strorm's father doesn't approve of Angus Morton's unusually large horses, calling them blasphemies against nature. Little does he realize that his own son, his niece Rosalind and their friends, have their own secret aberration which would label them as mutants. But as David and Rosalind grow older it becomes more difficult to conceal their differences from the village elders. Soon they face a choice: wait for eventual discovery or flee to the terrifying and mutable Badlands..."

    "review": "A sweet tale of kindness. I asked for recommendations for Christmas‚Äìfeelings books, and this is one that came up, and it does indeed do a good job of getting those feel‚Äìgood vibes going.<br /><br />The story is a little sickly sweet, but that's okay. I particularly liked the first 1/4 of the story that follows Louise, an unexpected adopted mother to Hope. This part is particularly tender and gentle.<br /><br />The book definitely left me with the desire to follow the Christmas traditions that's created in the story, which as the book ends, it's followed by real life stories of individuals who did just that.<br /><br />I have the kindle version that, unbeknownst to me, included some twenty-odd true stories at the end, making up around 20% of the kindle edition. I read a few of these, but they did follow the same pattern, and eventually skipped over a few feeling it was similar to reading an appendix of a book (and yes, this makes me a little bit of a terrible person!!!).<br /><br />Overall: does the job I had hoped it would do: get me in the mood for Christmas by reminding me of the \"gift of giving (love)\".",

    "review": "I didn't quite expect the book (read on my Kindle) to be *quite* that short.<br /><br />It's more of a scene than a book - which is fine, but exceptional short!<br /><br />As the synopsis says, it's a story of a couple that want to share Christmas gifts but it comes at the cost of the possessions that are most valued to them.<br /><br />In that, it's a tale of kindness and sacrifice. Except that the possessions they sell for the funds are spent on the one thing that complements the other's valuable possession, ie. Beautiful brushes for beautiful hair (that was sold to raise funds).<br /><br />And in that this is a warning that possessions and gifts do not make one happy. Love does that, and it can't be bought.<br /><br />The story also smacks of \"older\" times from New York (though I can't remember whether it was based there or not), and as such, even though both the man and woman make the same mistake, it seems that the woman is somehow left to blame and the man gets away with lounging back on the sofa.<br /><br />Sure, those are words from the time, but I've really no idea how people are reading this book today and leaving reviews saying they're left with a year in their eye, etc. Left me feeling sorry for the poor sods.",

Henry's classic tale of Della and Jim, the struggling newlyweds so anxious to give each other a Christmas gift that each sells the one thing the other holds most dear, receives an oddly lifeless treatment here. Heyer's meticulously detailed illustrations are pretty but stilted; the characters look like mannequins. The rueful Jim fares better than poor prematurely middle-aged Della, who at times looks more like his mother than his wife. Still, the story is as touching as ever, and neither time nor mediocre artwork can dim its glory. All ages."

    "review": "I read the first installment of the Murderbot a few months back (as an Amazon single), but after reading it, I decided I was going to pony up the ¬£8 for the following 3 books - although probably the most I've spent on a single book, let alone 3 books - absolutely totally worth it. I **loved** this series.<br /><br />The series follows Murderbot, a rouge security unit, mostly good at killing but who would rather just watch TV and be left alone. The first book reads easily as a stand alone, and I'd say the second book does too. <br /><br />The third and fourth pull together all the previous adventures into an overarching story that we see Murderbot learning about itself and struggling with the the concepts of emotions and desires.<br /><br />In fact, the Murderbot ends with that huge question of: what do you want.<br /><br />There's so many things I enjoyed about this series: it's a sci-fi that doesn't really require you to understand all the ins and outs of the political systems that exist in the world. I've read a few sci-fi books that really struggle to make the world believable because there's often so much to take in - the Murderbot diaries does this in a way that reads easily and lightly.<br /><br />The action sequences are really well written and fairly easy to follow - another thing I've struggled with in other books.<br /><br />Even though we know that the Murderbot is a construct, it exists in a time that emotions can be simulated - and therefore felt - by the Murderbot, which, just like any one of us, they don't relish having to process those emotions, and they'd much rather just shun away and hide away escaping with TV.<br /><br />Finally the characters are refreshing. As a white man myself, I'm too quick to assume the gender and race of the characters I reading about, Martha Wells does a really good job of keeping me in check, reminding me that Murderbot _doesn't_ have a gender, there's people in the universe that don't identify as one gender, and that not everyone is white. I love this, and I appreciate it in the books I read (in the hope that it shifts my mindset).<br /><br />Loved it.",

    "review": "The two stars are for: fairly decent writing, it wasn't a rabib page turner, but it was relatively easy going for the most part.<br /><br />The second star is for such an interesting idea: a cure for death - or more specifically, a genetic cure for the aging of cells.<br /><br />The story leaps right into this concept and the mental struggle the protagonist, John, faces with the prospect of living forever (or until something else kills him). <br /><br />The possibilities of this concept are endless‚Ä¶but it felt like this book struggled to grapple with these ideas and, for me, just failed to follow through.<br /><br />For instance, there's a key character (you'd be lead to think) that appears right at the start, that captures John's intrigue (and frankly I thought they were related to \"thriller\", but apparently not). This character then isn't mentioned at all for the majority of the book, and then around 85% of the way through when they suddenly reappear and John _suddenly_ declares his undying love.<br /><br />> She sighed. ‚ÄúI told you. I‚Äôm tired of men falling in love with me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit.‚Äù I moved to her and began kissing her.<br /><br />Oh for heaven's sake. She just suddenly does a 180 on her own feelings and goes for a full shag before leaping off to a nuclear winter.<br /><br />The story spends a solid half of the book on John and his family and surrounding and the (local) effect of the cure. No thriller in sight, and certainly no End Specialists. I can't tell if this was more of a drama or just a _lot_ of character building, but it really didn't feel like I got into the meat of the book until much, much further along.<br /><br />This book comes with an alternative title of \"Postmortals\" (I read The End Specialist), which would frankly makes a lot more sense. As for being a thriller - I don't think so. <br /><br />Also with this kind of massive change in humanity, the worldwide ramifications would be huge, and though John does try to portray these in his documentary-like updates (a blog?), it really feels quite local to Amuricka.<br /><br />Sadly the book deals with an excellent concept, but fails to deliver.",

Describing emotions and the tiniest moments in such a loving and tender way.

    "review": "Quite brilliant.<br /><br />The books I've read previously create pockets of world's to tell a story in. The War with the Newts, Capek create an all encompassing story that not only covers the entire planet earth, but also allows for economical, sociological, financial and political effects of the tale being told.<br /><br />The book can sometimes come across as a quite dry historical account of how the world, and indeed, mankind came to exist with the Newts. But then throughout the book we follow a very small number of characters and eventually returning to the butler who burdened himself with the guilt of introducing the newts to the world, which leads to the inevitable near-end of mankind.<br /><br />I found the story telling quite brilliant in the ability to describe, in such believable detail, the impact of these newts being on earth, the changes to their environment that allowed for their growth and the world wide impact of this ecological change.<br /><br />But it was the last two chapters that really won the story for me. The penultimate chapter has us revisiting the butler in his 70s taking a rowing trip with his son, and where he so confidently tells his son that they're safe in Prague. His son isn't so sure, and in a turn towards the end of the chapter, we see that the butler has been carrying the torment of \"what if‚Ä¶\", what if *he* had made a different decision: would the world's fate be in safe hands now?<br /><br />Then the final chapter was (again, sorry) quite brilliant. A discussion between the author and himself as the writer, trying to determine if mankind's fate is truly doomed. Whether humankind has any way to save itself from its own inevitable self destruction through greed and fear. Or whether the newts are inevitably prone to the same failings as humankind too‚Ä¶<br /><br />A tough, and sometime dry read, but really quite excellent!",

      "description": "From Amazon.com:<br /><br />THE SIXTH BOOK IN THE NOW LEGENDARY BRENTFORD TRILOGY<br />Yes they‚Äôre back, Jim Pooley, John Omally and all the lads from The Flying Swan. And this time they are up for a bit of good old Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll.<br />It‚Äôs all down to John Omally really, he had always nurtured a secret ambition to become a rock star. He had mastered air guitar and bedroom mirror posing and all he really lacked for was talent. So, when a remarkable rock band named Ghandi‚Äôs Hairdryer comes to play in Brentford and John learns that they are looking for a manager, he can see a bright and profitable future laid out before him. He will become the new Brian Epstein.<br />Jim Pooley, John‚Äôs bestest friend, isn‚Äôt too keen. Because there is something rather odd about this band. Something other worldly. It might be the lead singer Litany, whose voice can heal the sick. She might be an angel. Or perhaps a devil. Because this is Brentford, after all. Jim would rather just concentrate on his own schemes for making it rich. His betting system, to pull off the six-horse-super-yankee accumulator bet. That future generations will know as The Pooley.<br />Norman the scientific cornershop keeper is hoping to help Jim out, by building him a race horse. It looks a simple enough matter, according to the back of the cigarette packet he‚Äôs worked out the entire genetic engineering project on. But there are always interruptions and things are turning decidedly strange in Norman‚Äôs kitchen lab.<br />Soap Distant has just returned from a journey to the centre of the Earth, and Soap isn‚Äôt happy. Things have changed since he‚Äôs been away. But things that happened before he went away. Someone is messing around with time. Why else would Richard Branson‚Äôs face be on the money?<br />Inspectre Hovis is at his wits‚Äô end, very odd things are occurring in the borough of Brentford, folk appearing from nowhere, mysterious goings on and now the concert. The really big concert in Gunnersbury Park, the one where the Beatles will be playing, and Jim Morrison and Elvis too. That should be a concert worth watching, as long as nothing goes wrong.<br />And something might. Something really really big.<br />Because this is Brentford after all."

    "review": "Wow. I loved this book. I'm not entirely sure how I found it - I suspect Amazon randomly recommended it to me, and it was definitely a random purchase - but so glad I did.<br /><br />I'd just finished reading Snow Crash which has a small character which is an enhanced dog (called a Rat), and a few years back I'd read <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22358.We3\" rel=\"nofollow\">We3</a> which has animals who escape a tyranny of human kind‚Ä¶so I think I was expecting something like that. I was wrong!<br /><br />The book opens from the point of view of Rex, a \"bioform\" dog - part machine, part dog, part human DNA. The first few pages read as a little trite \"I am Rex. I am Good Dog\" etc - but this quickly falls away as I realised the darkness of what was being described from Rex's point of view. <br /><br />Then each chapter is told from different individuals point of view, including Hart - the engineer/carer for the bioforms, Honey - a bioform Bear and many other characters.<br /><br />The story is split over 5 parts that, I can assume, is covering several years. It starts in a war torn country, but once this part is over, the story goes on to raise the question of the bioform's rights, and whether a human-made thing can be human if it can feel for itself. By <em>human</em>, we mean the condition rather than the species.<br /><br />The story is a mix of the future of AI and augmented lifeforms, fear of different, corporations and their relationship with slavery - and through it, somehow, the protagonist is a dog that I can actually relate to as he even evolves through the book (the author does a brilliant job of evolving Rex's language and vocabulary as Rex is exposed to more of the world and the story moves on).<br /><br />Other thoughts that this book brought up for me:<br /><br />- If humankind make a <em>thing</em> and a thing can think for itself, should it have rights? What does that process look like - and how long does it take?<br />- Can and should humankind survive in it's current state. Is an augmented human less or more human? <br />- A fully autonomous intelligence is effectively immortal, so it can also outlive generations of humankind until the generations come to accept it?<br /><br />If you're interested in how technology can evolve in our future with AI, singularities, and the like, then I'd definitely recommend this book. <br /><br />I loved this story, really great stuff!",

    "review": "My hospital read! I spent a day and night in hospital for tonsillitis, and managed to read through this book (though there's not a whole lot to do in hospital!).<br /><br />Originally this book was destined for a 3 star, but the last 5th of the book started to really pull the story together and made for quite a fun and gripping ending.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I selected this book to read because it was Ben Elton, and I'd read a few of his books before and was expecting satirical, witty and possibly funny. I did not expect this book! The characters are certainly witty, but there's no comedy to be found. This is a dark detective story.<br /><br />The story did feel a little crowded for the first half, it follows the protagonist Edward Newson, a detective inspector and a good one to boot. Newson is extremely well centred with respect to his work, and it makes him a good detective. <br /><br />In his personal life, he's off centre, but as the reader, I found his judgement quite questionable - and I'm not 100% sure if his character arc leaves him any better at the end.<br /><br />At the surface of the story, we have a murder mystery. A pretty graphically gruesome murder. Then there's some very strong elements of sex - and very graphic hardcore sex (which, I didn't really realise I was signing up to). Then there's a heavy bullying theme: how if affects an individual decades on, how the bullies continue to live, if they can move past it, whether it's rooted to their soul or not. Then there's unrequited love. Then there's nostalgia and reaching into the past and trying to rekindle feelings of hope and love and happiness.<br /><br />So‚Ä¶yeah, it felt a little crowded.<br /><br />Thankfully the last quarter somehow manages to pull a lot of the themes together (and drops a few on the way).<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed the story and enjoyed the gripping ending. It did all tie up a little too nicely, but then it's a story, so why shouldn't it?! :)",

On the title alone, I probably would have ignored this book, but the contents is absolutely superb.<br /><br />If you're interested in nutrition and how the human body works (and obesity/fat and type 2 diabetes) then this book is a superb match.<br /><br />The majority of the book is dedicated to understanding the problems of food consumption and how it affects our bodies.<br /><br />Importantly, the pages are chock full of references to real scientific studies that support the claims.<br /><br />The last part of the book is dedicated to long term maintenance and long term change (since all diets eventually fail due to the body adjusting it's energy expenditure for the calories being consumed). This is where the studies are a little thinner on the ground, bug Fung uses logic to argue his case (there are *some* studies, but not as such high frequency as the rest of the book).<br /><br />All in all, this book has changed my views on dietary fats, helped me understand why we get fat and finally shown me why fasting works.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",

I loved the inner monologue that went with the Hell Hound!<br /><br />I don't think I've read a story with so many characters intertwining throughout a story (though, truth be told: I've not read many stories!) - and this book did a superb job of keeping all the characters unique, interesting and coherent.<br /><br />The story (for me), started fairly light (in heart) and towards the last quarter it goes rather dark - although this may be to be expected as the Armageddon is at hand. This also did wonders for my nightmares (I had three consecutive nights dreaming about my own End Of The World dreams).<br /><br />I'm also really impressed that two different authors created the story in a way that feels completely unified (and this edition included a Q&A chapter at the end where Pratchett and Gaiman share their process and thoughts on each other).<br /><br />Really fun stuff and included some real laugh out loud moments. The entire last chapter could have been highlighted too - beautiful closing message.",

The story uses a unique story telling device where it's told from the boys mind (or imagined diary), but the result is a stream of consciousness, littered with rule-breaking authoring techniques. <br /><br />I can imagine this method coming off as forced or trite. But Haig's book manages to execute really well.<br /><br />There's some vivid scenes of loss that touch my own personal childhood, remembering my own mother in the early chapters. <br /><br />The boy himself believes he's being visited by his deceased father who asks him to enact revenge for his recent death. <br /><br />The boy, Philip, struggles with his own confused feelings of being a boy, being 11 and starting to see more of the world, and being thrown into a new family structure. It's all too much for him.<br /><br />Being inside his head you can understand his actions, and it makes me wonder about how we judge someone from the outside who behaves so oddly or \"badly\".<br /><br />Ultimately we're left to decide for ourselves whether the boy is really seeing ghosts, though one thing is clear by the end: he'll need counselling to get through the next 15 years.<br /><br />A good, fast, little read, perfect for holiday reading.",

Now the only downside is that it _is_ a short, I finished it so quickly and I don't get to enjoy more of the murderbot protagonist.

I'm always amazed at how current a book written in 1931 can be so current and readable nearly a century later in 2018.<br /><br />The Brave New World is set in a future some centuries away where happiness is society's key. Religion, art, science and truth have been sacrificed to archive global sustainable happiness. <br /><br />People are engineered from embryo though constant tweaking at the fertilisation process and growth, then though as children conditioned using Pavlovian techniques: you read a book, you get zapped - aged 18 months. Aged 6 the children engage in \"erotic play\". Sleep hypnosis with rhymes that the individuals will live inside society with. Each individual is predestined for a class in society: alphas, betas, down to the \"epsilon semi-morons\" - button pushers. <br /><br />All seemingly pretty grotesque, but much later in the book, the benefits of this new world are argued, and it's a fairly convincing argument. Everything is for the sake of happiness. <br /><br />Ignorance is bliss. The less truth there is to be sought, the more content you are with your reality. And thus, a stable, sustainable, healthy society.<br /><br />---<br /><br />It seems as through there's three protagonist with increasing complexity to break the orthodox rules of the New World.<br /><br />Lenina allows herself to romanticise being with one person, and feeling love, but this is surface-deep and she's still very much a slave to her conditioning and unable to see beyond these walls.<br /><br />Bernard Marx, an Alpha plus who appears visibly as a Delta, with nasty rumours that alcohol had been slipped into his fertilisation process. He is able to think and speak outside of his orthodox conditioning but when it comes to acting, he falls short, and in fact proves himself more of a coward (or in fact probably as most would act: though inaction).<br /><br />John (the) Savage is different. He has a mother. He's learnt of God, learned to read and reads Shakespeare. He was born an outcast in The Old World (The Savage Reserve), and brought into the New World when Bernard and Lenina stumble upon him and his mother (originally from the new world but became injured and lost in the reservation some 20 years prior).<br /><br />John is the only one who questions and tries to change the new world that he now lives, and, obviously fails. The new world is centuries in the making. <br /><br />John is relatable because he comes from *our* time. And this is why he's a man out of time. <br /><br />There's nothing he can do to change society in an impactful way, and even if he did, it would be at the sacrifice of happiness of others. <br /><br />It's almost an inevitability that he goes mad. That he doesn't survive this brave new world. He can't. He can't escape it, and so, in the end, like any good Shakespeare tragedy, he tries and fails to extract himself from society, as it's impossible, in a rage of madness, goes on to kill the woman he loves, and then himself. <br /><br />An amazing, and maddening tale.

    "review": "(warning: not really a review, more of a thing to remind me of the book)<br /><br />Overall, a fairly cinematic story akin to the genre I'd expect The Matrix to fall into. If I'm completely honest, I did occasionally lose track of what was going on through the story (it took me a good few weeks to read it), but the story and two main characters managed to carry me along.<br /><br />I also have to admit that it took me a little while to get past the corny named main character \"Hiro Protagonist\" and the overly macho techno all black, motorcycles and swords. Of course, Hiro is the world's best swordsman‚Ä¶obviously. Though when I just went with it, it was pretty good fun.<br /><br />Neal Stephenson writing was extremely good at visualising a scene and the objects in the world the characters live in (in reading the acknowledgement I learnt that the book was intended as a graphic novel and I wonder if there was graphic work he was describing). All the same, it was very easy to read and see the world as we moved from reality, to the metaverse (virtual world), to vehicles and different landscapes.<br /><br />There's a tonne of historical and religious background to the story too, most of which I understand to be based on real research (from our universe) and the depth of which was incredible.<br /><br />The Snow Crash is (supposed to be) a virus that exists in both the digital world and the real world. The story creates (perhaps tenuous?) links between computer/digital ideas and pre-biblical times explaining that the story of Babel was the first instance of the virus, transmitted through verbal programming, affecting humankind. <br /><br />The two other main-ish characters were Y.T (a young women/teenager who we follow in parallel with Hiro) and Raven. Y.T. is really fun, and perhaps more relatable since she's a little more \"regular\" (compared with Hiro) - just kitted out with lots of tricks in her suit.<br /><br />Raven is the uber baddie, throwing glass spears, cutting through bulletproof suits and generally being invisible. He definitely plays the \"main henchman\" really well, and we even get to understand his motives which I love for a \"proper\" baddie.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book, left a little confused about the motivation about some of the connections in the book (like what really motivates Y.T. to join forces with Hiro, or how Hiro was one of the first creators of the metaverse, yet he's somehow a promotor for his roommate's band‚Ä¶). <br /><br />Sorry, not much of a review, more a prompt for my own memory in years to come!",

    "review": "A future in my past written in a distant past. What an amazing book. Orwell's writing has lasted near perfectly (i.e. modern and in context) some 70 years later (which frankly blows my mind).<br /><br />The story breaks into three parts as we make our way into Winston's mind. Part 1 reads like I'm learning around his world and how he experiences it. The mundane work, the acceptance of his role, whilst he secretly scratches his mind back.<br /><br />In part 2, I feel like I'm taking into Winston's heart as he re-experiences the world and the life and love that still exists in it. I loved some of the expressions and sadness that came with those expressions. Such as Winston knowing that what he was doing was against the \"rules\", and that it was simply an inevitability of being caught and tortured. <br /><br />He believes that he's given up his body already to the world of 1984, and when the Thought Police catch him, they'll take his mind, and so long as he protects his heart, he'll live on.<br /><br />Part 3 is mostly from inside of Winston's mind, as O'Brian works firstly to break Winston's mind, but then puts it back together in The Party's form. The place that O'Brian (and thusly The Party) comes from is entirely bleak and worse, believable in my own reality today. <br /><br />O'Brian utters phrases like:<br /><br />> Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older? Nothing exists except through human consciousness.<br /><br />Bleak. <br /><br />Eventually, there's no winning. There's no happy ending. There never could be. Winston's heart is pierced, he's _made_ to love Big Brother, and only then, when he's fully remade in The Party's eyes, does it end. For him, and for us.",

      "description": "Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written."

    "review": "Wow this book was a slow read given that it was only 198 pages. It took me 4 weeks, which, isn't a huge amount of time, but the first 80% of the book felt like an age that just wouldn't end.<br /><br />I was originally going to rate this book 1 star but it changed toward the end (the last 20% as I'll explain).<br /><br />Holden Caulfield, as read by myself a near 40 year old man, is a bit of a whingebag, if put subtly. He's self centred and believes the world owes him something - god knows what though. The 1950s language doesn't really pose much of a problem (as I read it), and I appreciate that lives were very different to that of 70 years later in ~2018. Not being a teenager myself, I'm not pissed off at everyone for existing so I had trouble connecting to a large part of the story that Holden shares with me during the book.<br /><br />The book is also fairly heavy with 1950s sexism, and it isn't uncommon to come across lines like \"the trouble with girls is‚Ä¶\". It's hard to read and I can imagine how it perpetuates the image of men being above women for the following decades. Either it's reflecting how men thought at the time, or it re-enforces how they were <i>supposed</i> to think.<br /><br />Also, the trouble with Holden was that his (teenage) exaggeration made it hard to tell what was real and what was imagined and what was him simply trying to be older to his peers. Sometimes I was just confused as to what was real and what wasn't. But then he'd share his feelings about his family, sister and deceased brother Allie‚Ä¶<br /><br />When Holden <i>did</i> talk about his family, it seems like you're able to see the real Holden under all the complexities of being a teenager. Then finally, around the 85% mark, Holden shares with his younger (adored) sister, that if he could be anything he would be:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I mean-except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start going over the cliff‚ÄìI mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\"</blockquote><br /><br />I think, this is to say, he feels this unbearable responsibility to save his lost brother, and protect his family (and those around him) from the inevitable end.<br /><br />Although Holden meets and (rightly) flees from a questionable encounter with an old teacher, moments before that teacher shares what I think what has been eating away at Holden all this time‚Ä¶and possibly for future years to come:<br /><br /><blockquote>\"The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that wants to live humbly for one.\"</blockquote><br /><br />Something I realise that Holden struggles with, even at the early age of 16/17, and that he and many others, struggle with for year to come.<br /><br />---<br /><br />So, after what was a fairly painful experience over 4 weeks of listening to Holden's complaining and poor view of life, I've come to soften my view of the poor soul and realise that he's just tortured and struggling and that it just took a whole lot of pages to get to what's really important to him.",

      "description": "The hero-narrator of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. <br /><br />J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on <i>Time</i>'s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read."

The writing is extremely conversational (which makes for a nice change). <br /><br />It does occasionally feels a bit here and there, rather than centred, but I kept reminding myself that the book started as a one woman stand up, so it's understandable. <br /><br />None the less, the book is littered with (genuinely) laugh out loud moments (took me a good few minutes to stop laughing at the hearing-aid anecdote), and beautiful insights as well as kind words for those (of us) with mental illness.",

      "description": "Finally, after four hit novels, Carrie Fisher comes clean (well, sort of ) with the crazy truth that is her life in her first-ever memoir. In <i>Wishful Drinking</i>, adapted from her one-woman stage show, Fisher reveals what it was really like to grow up a product of \"Hollywood in-breeding,\" come of age on the set of a little movie called <i>Star Wars</i>, and become a cultural icon and bestselling action figure at the age of nineteen. <p> Intimate, hilarious, and sobering, <i>Wishful Drinking</i> is Fisher, looking at her life as she best remembers it (what do you expect after electroshock therapy?). It's an incredible tale: the child of Hollywood royalty‚ÄîDebbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher‚Äîhomewrecked by Elizabeth Taylor, marrying (then divorcing, then dating) Paul Simon, having her likeness merchandized on everything from Princess Leia shampoo to PEZ dispensers, learning the father of her daughter forgot to tell her he was gay, and ultimately waking up one morning and finding a friend dead beside her in bed. </p><p> <i>Wishful Drinking</i>, the show, has been a runaway success. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> declared it \"drolly hysterical\" and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> called it a \"Beverly Hills yard sale of juicy anecdotes.\" This is Carrie Fisher at her best‚Äîrevealing her worst. She tells her true and outrageous story of her bizarre reality with her inimitable wit, unabashed self-deprecation, and buoyant, infectious humor.</p>"

Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie‚Äîmagical, comforting, wise beyond her years‚Äîpromised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark."

Diarising his ramble in the form of a 'journey journal', Alan details the people and places he encounters, ruminates on matters large and small and, on a final leg fraught with danger, becomes - not a man (because he was one to start off with) - but a better, more inspiring example of a man. This deeply personal book is divided into chapters and has a colour photograph on the front cover. It is deeply personal. Through witty vignettes, heavy essays and nod-inducing pieces of wisdom, Alan shines a light on the nooks of the nation and the crannies of himself, making this a biography that biographs the biographer while also biographing bits of Britain."

Nach einem besonders brisanten Gesch√§ft setzt sie sich nach Schweden ab, wo ihr die gro√üe Liebe begegnet. Das bringt nicht nur ihr eigenes Leben, sondern gleich die gesamte Weltpolitik durcheinander...Spitzz√ºngig und mit viel schwarzem Humor rechnet Jonasson in seinem neuesten Roman mit dem Fundamentalismus in all seinen Erscheinungsformen ab. Eine grandiose Geschichte, die dem ¬ªHundertj√§hrigen¬´ an √ºberbordenden Einf√§llen, skurrilen Wendungen und unvergesslichem Charme in nichts nachsteht!"

No daydreaming of love. If you stick to this you will just about be okay.'\"</b> </b>\n</b><br /><br />A love story across the ages - and for the ages - about a man lost in time, the woman who could save him, and the lifetimes it can take to learn how to live<br /><br />Tom Hazard has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but owing to a rare condition, he's been alive for centuries. Tom has lived history--performing with Shakespeare, exploring the high seas with Captain Cook, and sharing cocktails with Fitzgerald. Now, he just wants an ordinary life.<br /><br />So Tom moves back to London, his old home, to become a high school history teacher--the perfect job for someone who has witnessed the city's history first hand. Better yet, a captivating French teacher at his school seems fascinated by him. But the Albatross Society, the secretive group which protects people like Tom, has one rule: never fall in love. As painful memories of his past and the erratic behavior of the Society's watchful leader threaten to derail his new life and romance, the one thing he can't have just happens to be the one thing that might save him. Tom will have to decide once and for all whether to remain stuck in the past, or finally begin living in the present.<br /><br /><i>How to Stop Time</i> is a bighearted, wildly original novel about losing and finding yourself, the inevitability of change, and how with enough time to learn, we just might find happiness."

Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America‚Äôs lonely and dispossessed, <i>Of Mice and Men</i> has proved one of Steinbeck‚Äôs most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films."

Eventually, he learned to appreciate life all the more for it.<br /><br />Everyone‚Äôs lives are touched by mental illness; if we do not suffer from it ourselves, we have a friend or loved one who does. Haig's frankness about his experiences is both inspiring to those who feel daunted by depression and illuminating to those who are mystified by it. Above all, his humor and encouragement never let us lose sight of hope. Speaking as his present self to his former self in the depths of depression, Haig is adamant that the oldest clich√© is the truest‚Äîthere is light at the end of the tunnel. He teaches us to celebrate the small joys and moments of peace that life brings and reminds us that there are always reasons to stay alive."

That is the question at the heart of We Should All Be Feminists, a personal, eloquently-argued essay ‚Äì adapted from her much-viewed Tedx talk of the same name ‚Äì by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of ‚ÄòAmericanah‚Äô and ‚ÄòHalf of a Yellow Sun‚Äô. With humour and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century ‚Äì one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviours that marginalise women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences ‚Äì in the U.S., in her native Nigeria ‚Äì offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a best-selling novelist, here is one remarkable author‚Äôs exploration of what it means to be a woman today ‚Äì and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists."
