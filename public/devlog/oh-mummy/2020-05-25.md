During development I've been using [Cspect](http://cspect.org/) and for certain bits like yesterday's Fisher-Yates shuffle, I'll use `% RND` to get random numbers.

However, I also want to prevent my game from being repeatable so I use `RANDOMIZE` as a standalone call which is supposed randomly seed the random functions:

> RANDOMIZE on its own (and RANDOMIZE 0 has the same effect) is different, because it really does randomise RND and % RND

And with any basic understanding of random numbers, they have to be seeded from something in the real world, so _time_ is used:

> RANDOMIZE uses the time since the computer was switched on. Since this has gone up by the same amount each time RANDOMIZE is executed, the next % RND does more or less the same. You would get better randomness by replacing GO TO 10 by GO TO 20.

â€¦and of course, when Cspect launches into my code to immediately run it, the time is *exactly the same* on each start up, so the seed, is also exactly the same! ðŸ¤¦
