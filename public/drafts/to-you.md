# To you

This makes my final post on The Pastry Box. Though its only been six posts, its felt like something different. Indeed early on I realised it was somewhere different that I could experiment with content.

Due to what was going on in my life at the time, the posts quickly became very personal, and I felt comfortable enough to share some of my darker thoughts. That hasn't gone away, and people have been remarkably kind in their response. I hope to be strong enough to bring this directly to my own blog.

For my final post I wanted to end on something I've been wanting to write about for years. In fact, I started writing a version of this post in 2008, but the text was long lost.

I wanted to acknowledge my wife, best friend, mother of my children and partner in all things: Julie.

We have a few anniversaries that we keep, but today, the 6th December would mark the day that we started "going out", dating, courting, whatever you'd like to call it, 18 years ago.

18 years marks a special year too, we've now been together longer in our lives than the time that we've not been together. Our halfway mark. I'm pretty damn proud to be her husband.

Julie's responsible for all kinds of things throughout my life. She supported me and stood by whilst I worked my arse off for my previous employer.

She'd bunk lessons at school with me as we'd sit in the canteen playing cards with friends.

We've spent uncountable nights getting drunk and being silly. Watching movies together and staying up late to watch *just one more* episode of 24.

We've been through the most terrible of times together, losing our Tia. We held on tight together and have arrived in our new life with our family as it is with Ellis and Seren *somehow* completing us.

For some reason I was lucky enough to find the person that makes me whole from such a young age, and some 18 years later Julie's *still* my best friend and the person whose life I always want to share.

I feel like we ran as two streams once, and now we run as a river. There's no separation that would unravel us. We're forever connected.
