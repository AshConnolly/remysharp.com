# My decade of blogging

Today marks the 10 year anniversary of my blog and it's blog posts. This, I suspect, will be a super self indulgent post harking back to memories of how I did things, and my aspirations for the next decade.

Regardless of whether this post is of interest to you: thanks for stopping by and reading ❤

## In the beginning

Although I retrospectively added a single older post, my first post on this blog was [Flickr geo tags](/2006/09/01/flickr-geo-tags). It's honestly nothing to write home about, and the following posts would be fairly mundane (comparatively), but that's okay.

I wanted to start a blog for a few reasons, but primarily as an online memory of things that would trip me up. Then knowing that I'd written about a problem before, I could just "google myself" to find the answer. I also wanted to share my experience of running a new business, using my blog as a diary.

Since I didn't have many of these "Google-able" problems, I also wanted my blog to reflect a bit of me too, so I included film reviews (at the time, Julie and I were visiting the cinema twice a week).

One of the unexpected (but in retrospect, obvious) side effect is that my communication skills have improved and so has my spelling. I always found English skills hard as a kid (everyone close to me is pretty sure that I have some degree of dyslexia), but as I practise writing and spelling more and more each month and each year, it's become much easier.

## Design & technology

My blog started out as a WordPress blog (and actually got hacked a number of times to promote viagra and cialis…which franky I've no idea… also why I eventually moved).

Since it was WordPress, it meant that the first (and second) design was a free template from the generous Wordpress theme designers. I registered remysharp.com on 13-June 2005, with the first incarnation of this blog on September 1st 2006 (and no, I have no idea what I did with the domain for those missing 9 months..!).

## What happened in those last 10 years?

I [started my company](/2006/09/05/birth), [won a CSS book](https://remysharp.com/2006/12/19/css-mastery-ipod-giveaway), [created a twitter script](https://remysharp.com/2007/03/20/how-to-add-twitter-to-your-blog-without-it-hanging-your-site) that would later appear on Bruce Campbell's website. I found a game I'd created mentioned [in American Scientific](https://remysharp.com/2007/03/23/the-day-i-appeared-in-scientific-american), finally did the [London to Brighton](https://remysharp.com/2007/06/19/our-london-to-brighton-bike-ride-and-route) bike ride.

I gave [my first conference talk](https://remysharp.com/2008/03/13/presenting-jquery-at-qcon), hacked and created [JS Bin](/2008/10/06/js-bin-for-collaborative-javascript-debugging), and later [launched our conference: ffconf](/2009/04/20/full-frontal-javascript-conference) (Full Frontal back then).

I had the [worst year of my life](https://remysharp.com/2010/12/31/2010-the-year-ill-never-forget#tia), and the follow year we had our [*rainbow baby*, Ellis](https://remysharp.com/2011/10/17/ellis-tennyson-sharp).

I started working on [JS Bin full time](https://remysharp.com/2013/08/14/jsbin-5th-birthday) and [hired a small team](https://remysharp.com/2013/09/24/i-am-hiring), talked openly about [paying to speak](https://remysharp.com/2014/03/07/youre-paying-to-speak).

[Seren joined our family](https://remysharp.com/2014/12/31/my-2014#family).

Returned to working [solo](https://remysharp.com/2015/01/05/reboot) and finally got my [body in shape](https://remysharp.com/2015/03/11/diet) and blogged about some of the [painful aspects of running JS Bin](https://remysharp.com/2015/09/14/jsbin-toxic-part-1).

I also launched [confwall](https://confwall.com) and number of other [smaller side projects](https://github.com/remy), like [nodemon](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/12/nodejs-rapid-development-nodemon).

And quite possibly a bunch of other important things. Mostly though, I started my family with my amazing wife and parter in life: [Julie](https://remysharp.com/2014/12/06/to-you).

So I welcome the next decade. 2016 to 2026. I'll be 48. Wow. Nearly 50. That's kinda weird. But, pretty consistent with how time works. See you in the next blog post ❤
