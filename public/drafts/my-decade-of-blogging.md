# My decade of blogging

Today marks the 10 year anniversary of my blog and it's blog posts. This, I suspect, will be a super self indulgent post harking back to memories of how I did things, and my aspirations for the next decade.

Regardless of whether this post is of interest to you: thanks for stopping by and reading ‚ù§

## In the beginning

Although I retrospectively added a single older post, my first post on remysharp.com was [Flickr geo tags](/2006/09/01/flickr-geo-tags). It's honestly nothing to write home about, and the following posts would be fairly mundane (comparatively), but that's okay.

I wanted to start a blog for a few reasons, but primarily as an online memory of things that would trip me up. Then knowing that I'd written about a problem before, I could just "google myself" to find the answer. I also wanted to share my experience of running a new business, using my blog as a diary.

Since I didn't have many of the problems, I also wanted my blog to reflect me a bit too, so I included film reviews (at the time, Julie and I were visiting the cinema twice a week).

One of the unexpected (but in retrospect, obvious) side effect is that my communication skills have improved and so has my spelling. I always found English skills hard as a kid (everyone close to me is pretty sure that I have some degree of dyslexia), but as I practise writing and spelling more and more each month and each year, it's become much easier.

## Design & technology

My blog started out as a WordPress blog (and actually got hacked a number of times which is why I eventually moved). Since it was WordPress, it meant that the first design was a free template (as was the second). I registered remysharp.com on 13-June 2005, with the first incarnation of this blog on September 1st 2006 (and no, I have no idea what I did with the domain for those missing 9 months..!).
