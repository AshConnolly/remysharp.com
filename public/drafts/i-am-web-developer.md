# I am a web developer. Not an engineer.

> Something I’m starting to realise and accept for myself: I’m a web developer. Not an engineer. Mostly an approach & understanding difference

This seemed to hit a cord with a few people, and others asked if I could embellish on those thoughts. So here it is.

## On titles

We love titles. Personally, in the last 5 years, I've preferred the *sound* of being an engineer, or a JavaScript engineer. I actually quite like *software designer*. But let's face it, it's all fluff.

The *engineer* bit is a little less fluffy and does actually carry meaning.

## Engineers

Calling yourself an engineer, when you're not actually qualified as an engineer is *sort of* a no-no. In fact, there's some [regulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer#Regulation) around the engineering titles - and certainly in the UK (according to the Wikipedia page), there's been petitions to protect the title.

Ignoring the regulations, to me, engineers are smart, educated (ideally in a form of engineering...) and specifically: solving complex computer engineering problems.

In a conversation I was having with Trek Glowacki, midway he replied with:

> Take a step back and understand the real engineering goal: SRP

I wasn't aware of any engineering goal, nor what [SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) stood for, nor did I *really* understand what the Wikipedia page was saying to me.

Honestly, I kind of feel out of my depth amongst engineers.

## I am web developer

I don't know why I thought it uncool to be a "web developer". Perhaps because it's utterly vague.

What "web developer" *does* mean to me though, is this:

Someone who writes code for browsers. Likely from the school of view source, is comfortable with drop in libraries, understands standards and *best practice* techniques. **A tinkerer.**

I've personally learnt my web development skills over a long period of time and nearly entirely through trial and error.

Coming to this realisation is by no means a slur against those people who call themselves engineers. If you do, it's quite likely I already have a great deal of respect for your knowledge and understanding if I've come across your work already.
