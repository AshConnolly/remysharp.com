# What do I do?

The year is 2016, and I'm writing this for my future self, mostly because I never know what I actually do from year to year. And maybe, just maybe, my kids might read this one dayâ€¦unliekly but a cute thought ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘´

## Business

I run my own web development consultancy and training company that consists of me (who does the coding and training) and Julie (who does all the logistics, events planning, accounts and more). My business is called [Left Logic](http://leftlogic.com), started back in 2006, and hopefully going well when I read this ago.

What do I do day to day? Currently I'm working for a client called [Snyk](https://snyk.io) started by [Guy Podjarny](http://www.guypo.com/)
