# Mirrors

I love my blog. It's the little corner on the web that I've etched out for myself and it's mine. I own the content. I own the software. I own the management of the DNS (since I can't really own a domain). If the shit goes south, it's on me to fix it. But equally, no one can pull the plug on my work. And if you visit this URL in 10 years, and it's not here, that's been my decision and no one elses.

I wanted to write about using third-parties.

Very recently I got a comment on this blog telling me that some snippet of code that I wrote shouldn't be hosted on this blog, but be a on a "professional platform" like github (for instance). At the very same time Rachel Andrew was writing about reliance on other platforms for her code demos (codepen I think, but her post isn't about codepen specifically).

To date, my blog has been online for a bit over 10 years. I've written the software for my blog so that I can lift it up and deploy it to pretty much and new hosting environment at the drop of a hat. I don't use WordPress (anymore) and I don't rely on content platforms like Medium (though it's possible you're reading this post on Medium or some other platform that I **syndicate** to).

Here on my blog I own my content. It won't go missing so long as I'm actively managing it (maintenance requires little to no work on my part).

Relying entirely on a platform like github for a place to host code is a mistake. But it is only a mistake if you intend and care about honouring access to that content for years, and **years** to come. Of course, conveniently github is a target for my distributed git repo (though it may not seem like that at times). But if github disappears, I have copies and backups (how fresh those backups are is a matter for discussion!).

You my dear reader, I hope, will outlast github.

Equally posting to Twitter and thinking that content belongs to you is just wishful thinking. I know individuals that will sydnciate **out** to Twitter (which I think is great, and I'd like to move to the model one day soon). If…when, Twitter goes away/changes those tweets will be lost.

The same is true for jsbin, codepen, jsfiddle and the like. One day they won't be there as you know them today. Do you want your content out? How do you get it out?

The latest example of this transition is Disqus. My blog (stupidly) relies on Disqus. And now they've announced that they're going to put ads in all the "free" hosted comments. I'm not cool with this.

Disqus is not doing anything evil. In fact, *how* they've managed to serve free comments for so long without needing more paid users is beyond me but the time has come when their offering has to change.

The reason I'm not cool with this is that *my content*, that I've put years and years of work into, that is well regarded and linked to throughout the web (and of course I mean the same is true of your content too), my content is driving revenue to Disqus now, either though their ads, through promoting their product (by using it) or by my deciding to remove ads and paying Disqus. Simply put: I'm being forced into a position because, and only because, I chose to rely on their platform for comments.

This is a great business model on Disqus' part, my hat off to them, and I'd do the same if I could.

My point is: I really have no right to be annoyed when my content is held hostage for cash. What did I expect when I was paying nothing for a service?

More recently I realised that in our house, to controls the light in the lounge is almost exclusively controlled through an Amazon Echo. But yet, when we move and a new family moves in one day in the far future, that echo won't be able to control the lights. The technology will be unsupported, or the protocols, or the plug it controls. But yet a light switch will always work…
