# ffconf 2016 news

It's March and Julie and I have started long talks about November's ffconf already! So it's time to share our plans with you, since it affects you directly!

## Time for a change

Ever since event zero in 2009, the feedback has been absolutely amazing and overwhelmingly positive. In the last 3 years we've sold out in 10 minutes.

You would ask us each year: do you plan to grow?!

I'd hear story after story of people missing out on tickets because our beautiful venue houses 278 people. So, now, it's time for a change.

Our venue has been the [immensely comfortable](https://twitter.com/prisca_eyedea/status/398744015539273728), century old working cinema: The Dukes of York. It adds a huge amount of personality and both Julie and I are extremely fond of it - as it's been a huge part of our journey.

However, it does only house 278 of you, and we do sell out **too fast**. We want the content from ffconf to be available to more people (though we do also publish all the [videos freely](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ)).

Here's the deal: we're not moving. We're going to do **two ffconfs**. The same event, repeated. Just like the theatre ðŸŽ­

## Twice

So far to my knowledge, no one has done this before, and we've been thinking about it since 2013, so this is the year: **Thursday, 10th** and **Friday 11th** of November.

The aim for me is to make the two days the same: the same amazing content, the same line up, the same order of speakers, the same dizzy experience.

We'll also be running another [diversity scholarship](https://remysharp.com/2015/08/28/diversity-scholarships) similar to last year, except we'll have more spots available (and it'll be announced a lot earlier this year).

## The other shake up

Since ffconf 2016 will be our 8th round, we're also going to shake the format up a little too. I'm hoping to run 12 sessions this year (instead of the usual 8). Talks will be reduced down to 25 minutes each, but this is a great length to take the content in. I'll be opening the CFP soon enough, and be sure that it'll look very much [2015's CFP](https://remysharp.com/2015/05/25/call-for-proposals-at-ffconf-2015).

## Costs

This won't affect ticket price (Â£160+VAT), but we need more cash to make sure we can cover the increased venue costs, speakers costs and honorariums and general outgoings of doubling an event. Ticket prices go towards this but it's actually the sponsorship that covers the majority of the big costs. So if you want to be involved in this hugely popular event, [get in touch](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=Sponsorship).

## Let's make this happen

Our event has managed to get to it's eighth year with your help and your hunger for the content (and the tickets), so we need your help to do it again, just twice as hard.

Keep an eye on the [@ffconf](https://twitter.com/ffconf) account for the latest announcements. Otherwise, we'll hope to see you in that cinema again.

With all our ðŸ’œ The Sharps
