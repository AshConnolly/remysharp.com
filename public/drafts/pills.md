# Pills

Dear reader, I've been meaning to share with you: I take antidepressants to help me cope being a parent.

I've been wanting to write about this for a while now, but I couldn't work out how or more importantly *why*.

## Why is simple

I read two totally different posts in recent months that both separately talked about the mental struggle the authors dealt with. The posts both surfaced the problems the authors were facing, but the heart of the message was: hey, if you're struggling too, you're not alone, there's help out there.

This is my blog. This is my dairy. This is my contribution.

## Antidepressants

For those that have followed my story over the years know the personal tragedy my family has been through.

I've always tended towards the sad and depressive from a very, very young age. I've been through some counselling in my life, and a lot more after Tia.

After Tia was born, it was uncommon for me to feel like I wanted to just watch the world burn down around me.

Combine this grief, with a general downward personality with new parenthood and the sleep deprivation that comes with it, and all too often my emotions would flip into anger. I know anger is hiding something else, but it comes on so fast that I can't stop to take a breath.

For my own record (and perhaps to avoid too much judgement): I've never hit my kids or wife. I would vent my anger myself or stationary objects. But it is still scary for a child to see (and often I would try hard to hide it), and frankly it's horrible for me too.



## Context is everything


I took three separate blocks of counselling, the last one was for about a year.

My wife and I went on to have two (more) amazing little people in our lives. I love them to bits and would give my life for them (as many a parent would).
