# A common security vulnerability

# General notes about regular expressions

- avoid using them to match code, since the code itself can contain a regexp and that'll trigger weirdness
- when using `.exec` remember to reset the `lastIndex` otherwise the regexp will start from where the last run finished
- understand the difference between `test` (simple bool), `exec` (runs to first match) and `match` (returns null if no match)
- understand that you can use `.replace` for string walking using a function callback
