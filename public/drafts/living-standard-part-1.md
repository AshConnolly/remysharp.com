- Overarching question: **Why do I believe in the web?**
- Being able to use computers to be creative
- Downloading an SDK over the day to develop for the Psion, but giving up because the barrier to entry was too high
- Buying an old PC for ¬£20, and going to the shops to get a CD so I could open the text file I had created in IE3.
- I was free to join the web, and to contribute to it, as silly as my ideas where. Whether they rendered in Netscape or IE or only on my own computer. This is empowering. But I'll also admit that it is also a privilege that I had that others may not.
- Sentiments from "why I love the web"
- Without being data driven, I *feel* like this year there's a been a lot of attention to posts that highlight the potential complexity of building for the web. This is certainly true, though odd that accessibility is pretty much always omitted (i.e. it feels like obsession with toolchains‚Ä¶), but it's not a prerequisite for building on the web.
- "‚òùJust a reminder in this sea of webdev despair: Minimum requirements to build a website üëâ üíª Browser üìù *Text* editor ‚è∞ Time üí™ Enthusiasm" https://twitter.com/rem/status/784038079636070401
- Just as any job, there's things you have to learn to get it done. The more technical the aim of a job, the more likely, IMHO, that the requirements become more complicated. Equally, if a company you try to get a job with, requires that you learn React, or Polymer, it's part of the job. As it is, if the company needs to support IE7 or IE8. It's a job. It might not be the most fun part of the job, but it's what you're paid to do.
- I love that the web is accessed by all kinds of browsers. This is our daily challenge, and frankly, it's getting easier as the browser vendors have all been upping their game to support standard proposals.
- And browsers have been evolving rapidly. In 2009, Bruce Lawson and I wrote Introducing HTML5 whilst it was still starting to appear in browsers (and frankly, some of the APIs we still a little shaky). 5 years later, the WHATWG version of HTML5 has become the HTML living standard, and continues to evolve. Browsers have also continued to evolve and add technology puzzle pieces that helps us developers realise really amazing applications that are distributed using the web.


# Why do I believe in the web?

I work pretty much all day on the web. I use it for research, I use it to socially, I use it professionally, I use it when I'm bored, or need inspiration. I'm constantly impressed by what I see on the web.

Here's the winner of the [13K JavaScript games](http://2016.js13kgames.com/) competition this year. No plugins. No complilers. Just browser code (and actually WebGL).

The web constantly amazes me. It constantly freely gives me access to information and ideas. It constantly challenges me. It constantly makes me laugh. The web, feels infinite. All this content and software, put out by ordinary people. Ordinary people just wanting to **share**.

**I feel humbled by the web.**

I'm a tinkerer. I need to be creative to keep myself happy. Computers are my tool, but the web is my distribution platform. I pay very little to contribute, and when I was younger (and not earning money), I was able to share freely on web sites like Geocities and Anglefire: essentially free hosting, precursors to myspace.

Under all the complexity of today's modern technology, and modern libraries and frameworks, the web, and programming for browsers is still small, simple and forgiving.

Browsers are tremendously clever. They can read simple text, and if you give the filename an extension of `.html`, the browser does a whole load of extra work for you:

Combined with the open source movement that has grown in momentum over the last decade, there's an enormous amount of free support through small libraries maintained (and abandoned!) by individuals, to projects like Dojo, jQuery, React, Angular and more that are supported by large teams and a huge number of community members. And all for free?

I don't have to use their code. Both due to the nature of *view source* in the browsers, but also, again, because of open source, I can read through the code that makes "things work" and learn from it.

Me, personally, I was writing a flavour of JavaScript back in 1998, and I never picked up a book on the topic. But it was when jQuery came along in 2006 that I took some time to read through parts of the code (and eventually got to know all of the code base). This taught me tonnes about code design and how JavaScript really worked. The source code also pointed to online articles that helped to inform decisions, and from the there I would learn even more, mostly from [Dean Edwards' website](http://dean.edwards.name/).

Nothing has changed this fundamental aspect of both browsers and the web. Yes, creating web sites can be a lot more advanced, but the truly **awesome** nature of the web, and its possibilities, has always been there.

That's why I still believe in the web.

## Creative outlet

Computers, for me and many others, is a way to express creativity. At it's peak, I never understood myspace.com. I was na√Øve. I didn't realise the importance of creativity in learning (even though I used this skill all the time myself).

I was extremely lucky to have a parent working in technology from an early point in time. We had a ZX Spectrum in our household from the early 80s. I remember trying to copy out reams of code from a magazine into the Spectrum. Taking me hours and hours and hours, only to be presented with something like `Q Parameter error`. Literally IDK `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`.

During the early 90s, my dad had bought a [Psion 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3). It was an early Personal Digital Assistant - sort of like a really small laptop with a monochrome LCD display - but what interested me most was that there was a public Software Development Kit (SDK) available. The potential to create my own application.

I'd already dabbled in writing my own applications using Visual Basic, but really the *BASIC* part of VB allowed me to wire up UI components to actions. If I wanted to do something more interesting, or produce an application that wasn't 4mb (which would have to span over 5 or 6 720K floppy disks!), I would have to learn Visual C++, which for the 13 year old me just wasn't going to happen.

However, the Psion was significantly more simple than a PC (and the related VC++ libraries), so I figured I should be able to learn just enough to make my own Psion application.

I found the FTP address of the SDK, and started to download the zip file over my 14K modem‚Ä¶which, suffice to say, was a very long and expensive phone call.

When the SDK was finally down, I was presented with lots of interesting directories, and `.c` and `.h` files, and PDFs with lots and *lots* of documentation.

<img class="half" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;" alt="oodles of SDK documents" src="/images/psion-sdk-trimmed.png">

However, there was no spring board directly in. I had to first learn about compiling, then linking, and memory, and pointers and stuff and more stuff and `(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª` (again). So, sadly, the 13 year old me aborted after that long wait, and never actually wrote anything for the Psion.

SDKs require time and experience and the ability to gain knowledge. And of course, when the Psion eventually died out (and I suspect many of you haven't even heard of the Psion), the knowledge of the SDK is completely useless.

## Access to the same doorway

The web allows me to share my work with friends, strangers, a handful of people or hundreds of thousands of people. I have the same opportunities and potential for reach as a multi-million dollar company.

Before the web was accessible in every home and a great deal of pockets, access to knowledge, ideas and creativity was limited. Usually limited to where you lived. Some of that still exists today. It really annoys me when there's a US release of a film that's either released locally months later or potentially not at all.

In these cases the distributors have control.

Where there are distributors for the web: we lose. Facebook is mostly a walled garden. To play, you must give up certain freedoms, like who can see what you share, or what information you have to share.

The open web is different. It's open. Unlimited. Unmetered. Unchecked. For better or worse.
