# Cost of a slide deck

I've been asked quite a few times in the past about slides, the work involved, whether or not to repeat talks, being paid, whether filming is okay and how does that all relate to workshops. So I've tried to write down my stand on things and hopefully this is useful to some of you out there.

I've been publically speaking [since early 2008](/2008/03/18/the-dom-scripting-toolkit-jquery) and I've made my fair share of mistakes over the years (hopefully learning from one or two along the way).

Firstly, **don't be afraid to repeat your talk**. This is important on a number of levels. Giving your talk in public on more than on occassion it allows you to get a feel for how what works and *real* timings.

I've met many people over the last few years that have come away from a talk saying they had seen it before, but really enjoyed it again. Remember are humans, we generally like to know what's coming next, it helps us focus more on the detail when we know what's coming already.

Also remember that many, many, *many* delegates won't have travelled around to see your talk, and many won't have the time to see your talk on film (as much as films are a great resource, few of us block book out entire days to watch an event full of conference talks).

Unless it's your job to speak publically on behalf of your company and their product, which it isn't for me, then my slide deck has been created in my own time (even if I work for myself - it's time I'm *not* being paid). It's taken a lot of hours to put the deck together, if it only gets to see the light of day *once* then I've done it an injustice.

Is filming a talk okay? For me, the answer depends on how it's published. **If the film is 100% free then it's okay with me**. To be clear what "free" is, that's not in exchange for your email address and that's not plastered with ads (though I understand that a film production might be funded by a sponsor, and I'd expect their logos, etc in the film).

What about filming workshops? Nope, absolutely not. Workshops take *a lot* of time to create and prepare, and serve a very small number of people. **I don't allow my workshops to be videoed because it would giving away the experience that I sell**. To be fair, I've only been ~~bugged about~~ asked once if the workshop could be filmed. O'Reilly wanted to film two of my workshops I ran at OSCON 2011. I said "no" because they would go on to be sold (either in exchange for your email address or money) on their web site. Essentially, my workshops are my *bread & butter*, I'm not going to give that away unless I'm 100% in control (i.e. running it for free myself).
