# Firefox devtools notes

A week of Firefox devtools

## Task: change font weight

- Increase font size - hover information and style editor code complete is not aligned
- Styles panel in elements is not linked to the style editor. Changes aren't linked so editing doesn't reflect.
- Unsure what green line is next to in the inspector view against CSS changes
- SVG icons for warnings (when CSS isn't valid)
- For compressed CSS, inspector view says "screen.css:1", but the styles editor automatically "pretty prints" so there's no link between line 1 and the style editor view
- In inspector, space is auto completed to `!important` regardless of cursor position *or* actual CSS property
