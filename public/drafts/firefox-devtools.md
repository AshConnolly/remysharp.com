# Firefox devtools notes

A week of Firefox devtools

## Task: change font weight

- Increase font size - hover information and style editor code complete is not aligned
- Styles panel in elements is not linked to the style editor. Changes aren't linked so editing doesn't reflect.
- Unsure what green line is next to in the inspector view against CSS changes
- SVG icons for warnings (when CSS isn't valid)
