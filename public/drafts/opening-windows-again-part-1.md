# Opening Windows again (part 1)

I've had the good fortune to be given a trial Microsoft Surface machine from the folks at Windows, and I agreed (and wanted) to share my particular experience with my return to Windows.

This first instalment will focus on the hardware and tactile aspects of the device (since mostly I'm still configuring my development environment on the machine).

## Unboxing: first impressions

- Good weight and balance
- Screen lifts well and leaves the keyboard seated
- Power unit has an extra USB port for charging additional devices which is a nice touch
- Pen has a really nice weight to it, and is magnetised to the edge nearest the trackpad - though I'd like this to be around the side so I can quick grab it and return it


## Aestheics

- Keys are really nice
- Cursors are a little small as I use them a lot to cursor up and down
- Biggest gripe is the trackpad. The biggest issue is that the left click doesn't always work. I'm using to clicking pretty much anywhere on my trackpad on my mac, so on Windows, it has to be in a specific area, so quite often, around 30% of the time (which is a lot), I'm clicking and nothing is happening. The second issue, lesser, is when clicking, the precision is slightly off - I start to click and the cursor will start to move.
