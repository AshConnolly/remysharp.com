# Faking progress

If you're familiar with the github.com website, then you'll be familiar with the effect (as of 2016) when you click from a repo to the issues or PRs or search for filesâ€¦there's a progress loader at the top of the page, and the updated content is loaded in.

I suspect it feels "ajaxy" to me because I've got a good sense of how websites work. That said though, visual feedback that _something_ is happening is useful (IMHO). I've recently started adding this _effect_ without the ajax part to give the user an impression of progress.

## Why "faking"?

I'm going to apply a progress bar across the entire site every time the visitor clicks on a link or submits a form. The reason for this is that there maybe some server side processing that needs to be done before the browser gets a response, and during that time it can still run code from the current page:

![Animation period](/images/anim-during-network.png)

Specifically, I'm going to kick off an animation that's visible until the initiated request starts to come back. I've edited a short video showing this in action (though its quick and there's a number of moving parts):

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/195803457" width="640" height="515" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

When (or why) would you use this? I'm using this process when I know the server can take a few seconds to respond (due to large API requests and related latency). I'm also finding it quite satisfying* session the web page respond to my direct input (even though the browser's chrome does offer feedback via the throbber against the tab).

<small>* note that this is not based on research and only my own experience.</small>

## Method 1: sans-brains

This is the noddy version, very basic, but works quite nicely. The big downside is if the visitor stops loading the page (manually), the animation remains in place.

I've added the following CSS to my styles (based on/taken from this [codepen](http://codepen.io/brunjo/pen/XJmbNz)):

```css
html.loading:before{
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  left: -200px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 4px;
  animation: loading 2s linear infinite;
  background-color: #B3E5FC;
}

@keyframes loading {
  from {left: -200px; width: 30%;}
  50% {width: 30%;}
  70% {width: 70%;}
  80% { left: 50%;}
  95% {left: 120%;}
  to {left: 100%;}
}
```

Then I add in a little JavaScript to enhance:

```js
// you can use jQuery, or these two lines from Paul Irish:
// https://git.io/blingjs
window.$ = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);
Node.prototype.on = window.on = function (name, fn) {
  this.addEventListener(name, fn);
}
NodeList.prototype.on = NodeList.prototype.addEventListener = function (name, fn) {
  this.forEach(function (el, i) {
    el.on(name, fn);
  });
}

$('form').on('submit', startLoader);
$('a').on('click', startLoader);

function startLoader(event) {
  if (!event.shiftKey && !event.metaKey && !event.ctrlKey) {
    document.documentElement.className = 'loading';
  }
}
```

The `startLoader` function includes an important check to make sure the visitor is intending to load the page in the current window, i.e. don't show the loader if they open a new tab.

## Method 2: intelligent service worker driven

Now that we've got a dumb version working, what about something a little more intelligent. Perhaps using Service Workers to handle the requests, and to emit events into the main window to notify of loading activity and equally, and importantly, notify of failed or cancelled loading.

It would even be possible to emit the loading event across _all_ the tabs on the origin (aka the domain) if you so wanted (though I think this might be confusing).
