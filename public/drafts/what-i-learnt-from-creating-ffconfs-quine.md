# What I learnt from creating ffconf's quine

Last year, 2015, at ffconf, I invited [Martin Kleppe](https://twitter.com/aemkei) to speak about his work and art using JavaScript. For his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QZSJx8oXus&index=7&list=PLXmT1r4krsTqtLdWln2ritJZTjd5a06h2), he touched on some of the quine's that he had created and [made one especially for ffconf](http://aem1k.com/ffconf/).

So this year, I decided to take his work, deconstruct it and recompile it to be printed on our t-shirts! Here's what I learnt.

- the trailing body tag regardless of innerHTML position
- random spacers
- Making the shape first (png to ascii)
