# Living standard

The web is a beautiful place. On the face of it: open to all. Complicated and yet still simple. Why do I still so strongly believe in the web? What's different today that makes the web so much more exciting than ever? And how can we help to keep the web a welcome and open place?

# Plain and simple

## Misc notes

Title: Living Standard

Abstract: The web is a beautiful place. On the face of it: open to all. Complicated and yet still simple. Why do I still so strongly believe in the web? What's different today that makes the web so much more exciting than ever? And how can we help to keep the web a welcome and open place?

- Web standards
- Not the latest technology
- But also the latest technology
- Don't be afraid to try things (though sometimes I am)
- What does the future look like.
- Why am I excited? It's taken years to get to the realisation that PWAs get us
- Social standards, more people learning to code, more support groups, more diversity, giving people oppotunities that wouldn't normally have the chance
- We're in a privilidge position, so we should use that to help others. To raise their voices.
