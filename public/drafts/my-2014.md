# My 2014

As with previous years (barring 2008, oddly), I've tried to wrap up the highlights of my year for future Remy's reading pleasure.

## Professional

This year has been a mixed bag from a professional stand point, mostly revolving around JS Bin.

## JS Bin

Back in September 2013 I decide that I would try to focus my full time efforts on JS Bin, and after speaking to many individuals at conferences and events, I decided that the right path would be to add Pro accounts.

Take up has been...okay. Except it took 8 months to actually get to launch. A mistake. It should have taken 2-3 months, and I shouldn't have been so hell bent on getting it perfect. Putting 100% effort into a project with no capital and no income meant a pretty serious hit to my own business.

All in all, not a huge success, not really a medium success either. But over time it'll make some money and hopefully. There's also a couple of other business models I can explore, but my biggest problem is I'm not a particularly good business person.

That all said, JS Bin is going no where. I've run it as side project for over 6 years, and I'll continue to run it that way. There's production grade servers in place, something like 12 million bins in our database and lots of cool stuff still to be done. And the truth is, when it's fun to work on JS Bin, it's *fun*.

## Left Logic

At the start of the year I took on a new office (actually the same size as what I had before, but I was the sole tenant this time) and I took on two new full time employees [Fabien O'Carroll](https://twitter.com/allouis_) and [Giulia Alfonsi](https://twitter.com/electric_g), and also [David Gauld](https://twitter.com/dcgauld) as a part time/freelancer.

But as the year went on, I couldn't (afford to) renew Giulia contract and Fabien was tempted away by local Brighton company, Brandwatch (I'm proud to say after he turned them down a few times first).

It's been a huge pleasure working with Giulia and Fabien - they're both great people to know and damn good developers. David's led the [Left Logic](http://leftlogic.com) redesign and is continuing to contribute to Confwall (a new product from Left Logic).

But as 2015 starts, there's no point in having an office *just* to myself, so I'm selling all the kit, closing the office and returning to a roaming desk, for all the excitment and concern I have!

## Speaking & Travelling

Over the last few years I've been reducing my public speaking further and further down. This year I only gave two differnt talks and only three events.

I'm not terribly proud of the talks either, and I feel like they were either duff notes or bombed entirely. Obviously you have a different perspective on things from the stage, but it's definitely put me off speaking for a while.

I did do an epic write up of my [real-time talk on my blog](/muddling-my-way-through-real-time).

On the flip side though, I did spend more time attending events just to learn. Oddly, I had quite a few people exclaim "are you speaking?!". That's cute, but there's certain perks to not speaking: like *not speaking*!

Particular highlights for me were:

* [Dareconf mini](https://2014.dareconf.com/mini/london) (London, UK)
* [Edge London](https://edgeconf.com/2014-london) (London, UK)
* [Hybrid Conf](http://www.hybridconf.net/) (Stockholm, Sweden)
* [SmartWeb](http://www.smartwebconf.com/) (Bucharest, Romania - where I also spoke)
* [JSConf EU](http://2014.jsconf.eu/) (Berlin, German - more for the people & conversations)

## ffconf

This year, our little event sold in two batches, going in 6 and 3 minutes. Insane.

I was nervous about this year because I had lot a speaker that I really want to hear and I was struggling to find the right balance of what I wanted. There's also the simple problem that each year has been better than the last, so eventually it has to do worse.

I was wrong to be nervous.

The event was amazing (from me as an attendee point of view) and the [feedback](http://www.outsidethepage.co.uk/full-frontal-2014/) was [equally](http://www.uvd.co.uk/blog/full-frontal-2014-highlights/) [positive](http://kyan.com/blog/2014/11/11/full-frontal-2014).

See for yourself - all [eight talks from ffconf are available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTqrwW2jjXIXuCtFQ-5BIn-s).

## Projects

Although there's not as many side projects as I'd like this year, it's clear to me that JS Bin has been consuming my focus for the large part of the year, and that's *okay*!.

* [Confwall](https://confwall.com) - a productised version of the twitter wall I've run at ffconf for the last 6 years. Currently open to early beta registrations.
* [Rest pebble app](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/53ff41ed8cdf37902b000050) - a native C app for the Pebble watch that lets me quick set rest timers at the gym.
* Blog moved from WordPress (to a Harp/custom node app) and resumed blogging again - something I've wanted to do for a long time, and I blogged about the process and also all on [github](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com): [part1](/harp-pt1), [part2](/harp-pt2). I'm most proud of the [archive](/archive/) page.
* nodemon 1.0 - then pretty much abondonning it for a 11 months and revisiting to add some sweet functionality (look out for 1.3.x in the new year)
* Introducing HTML5 - this is *still* in the works to be published for free. Watch this space!

## Personal

In ascending order:

### Writing

Rewiring my blog has encouraged me to blogging again. I've long fallen out of love with Twitter and return to blogging. I said before, but the [archive](/archive/) of my blog has really encouraged me to carry on. I'm pretty proud of the content.

This year I was also invited to the Pastry Box project, where I started posting some very personal thoughts, and I'm proud to be [hosting them here too](/tag/personal). The three particularly important ones being [Time doesn't heal](/time-doesnt-heal), [My Velveteen Rabbit](/velveteen) and [Motivation](/motivation)

### Me

I'll spare you the pictures this time (though if you want to brave it, [here's last year](/my-2013#personal))! **Last year I ended my body fat on 19% (down from 30%).**

I've been using Fitbit Aria scale, but over the months have lost confidence in their accuracy, so bought a pair of cheap, but more reliable skin calipers.

My body fat at the end of December 2014 (and over the month of December) is **currently 13.8%** (the scales are reading around 10%, which I don't trust). I also fit into 30 inch jeans and tops that I wore at aged 21 are baggy around my belly (yes, I have a few tops that are over 15 years old!).

My lowest weight (not that I want to be light) was 11 stone. I can see a 6 pack forming (which I've *never* had in all my years).

**My biggest deadlift was 170kg**, but I also tore a disc in my lower back trying to do a superset at 140kg (what had previously been a warm up weight). That cost me a month off the gym and 3 months self impossed ban on deadlifts and squats.

Diet is still heavy protien (and I found it quite easy to eat 1500kcals in a day whilst still having 7 meals a day), but I'm trying to add weight at the moment and if I'm honest, I'm struggling!

**Bottom line: 13.8% is in the *Athletes* range of body fat. So the future version of me, reading back, should be damn proud.**
