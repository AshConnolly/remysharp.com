# 5 non-technical wins on the web

Too often I read about how native is smoother or more responsive or more offline or more pazzow! I wanted to share a few observations where web destroys native.

These pros are from the user perspective, and it bears remembering web has these *natural* advantages over native, in that there's no technical work required by the developer.

From a technical implementation perspective, web will always be behind native. *Always*. Whilst the web is an open consortium and not a locked in proprietary platform. That's the competitive advantage of being private.

Although...we are seeing a *lot* of innovation landing. Offline, storage, first class control of http requests and more.

But let's get on with this.

## 1. Installation speed

Saving URLs to your home screen counts as an installation, and that discoverability definitely needs to be improved, but if the user "installs" to their home screen, the process is lightning fast.

Having previously been an iPhone owner, and having gone through the system restore process, I was always starkly aware that all the web apps I had pinned to my home screen were there to use immediately. Everything else: took hours to re-download to become usable.

## 2. Multi-tasking by default

All (if not *nearly* all) browsers support tabbed browsing. This gives the user the ability to multi-task.

I was using the Amazon's "native" app on my Android, and browsing for a product, I went to put a few products aside, so I could quickly compare them all... oh. No tabs.

In the browser, I'll fire off a "open in new tab" and come back to it in a moment. This is a powerful feature.

## 3. Sharing


## 4. Available on all the platforms regardless of status in society

Sure, you can fuck it up, but by default, you don't have to do anything special, or pay Apple for a publisher's account (for instance) to access your web site on an Apple device.

## 5. Good and *open* security

 (origin policies, permission systems, etc)
