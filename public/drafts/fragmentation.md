# Fragmentation

Inspired by [@codepo8's talk](http://vimeo.com/54188798) - go watch it (or maybe after you've read this short post).

Fragmentation may present you with a problem. It may mean you have more work on your hands. It may mean you decide "screw this, I'm moving to Objective-C". Fragmentation is in everything we do on the web: desktop machines, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, feature phones, screen resolutions, screen dimensions, linux, Mac and Windows, different versions of OS, [different compiled versions of the same browser](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/10/there_is_no_web.html), different hardware released in different decades and finally different network providers. So yep, it's everywhere. 

But this *is* the web. Fragmented. Individual. Unique. 

As Christian also points out in his talks, those Flash developers that told you they jumped to Flash because of fragmentation<sup>&daggar;</sup> - have never actually written Flash. There's different versions of Flash with varying support of their platform, but also Flash Lite (for mobile phones).

&daggar; Actually, those Flash developers that jumped from browser dev to Flash wouldn't cite fragmentation directly, it was lack of consistent browser support...which is actually just fragmentation both in the platform you'd write for, but also the degree of which a language is supported.

But sure, if "Flash is dead" - we've got iOS to jump ship to. But we're already starting to see fragmentation there too (even as simple as the screen resolution, let alone different mobile capabilities).

One of the real highlights for me
