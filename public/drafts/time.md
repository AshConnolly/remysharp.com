# Time

I lay in bed last night thinking through line from a film I'd seen earlier that day. A question. 

"If you could see your whole life would you change anything?"

<!--more-->

At the time, last night, I thought of something important. Time and the thought of being able to change it is something I've thought a great deal about. 

As I lay in bed, my mind wondered deeper down these ideas until I eventually fell asleep. I knew I wanted to write them down.

Instead, of course, I woke up to only a fuzz of a memory of what I had thought. Simply replaced by my dreams. 

My dreams that involved countless deaths. Murdered by monsters that had been turned, fire scorn skin, all fighting to get something. To get me, and to meld my soul with another, wielding some new creature out of me. Some kind of new monsters, bigger than the others. 

The strongest memory of my dream was when a man-monster grabbed me in a stairwell, and as a grappled to free myself, his skin started to peel off, so I tore all of his face off, and he continued, so I reached *into* his head and dug out his brain and he carried on his attack.

Nothing could stop the inevitable ending though.

Suffice to say, I took me all morning to shake that off, and several hours later to remember my late night thoughts.

Time.

All my thoughts and feelings about this are dictated by losing Tia at birth in 2010.

In a way, our memory serve as a time machine. It allow me to go back. It doesn't really matter if the memory is a perfect replica of what actually happened because we all experience events in our own way, so if the memory of that event is (inevitably) different, its…normal.

I often go back to the night Tia was born. 

If we knew we would lose Tia, would we, Julie and I, do it all the same again?

What if time wasn't linear? What if we could move between time, back and forth? 

Surely with that knowledge we would make changes. To better ourselves, possibly our situation, hopefully other people's situation.

But then, if we could make decisions, or more specifically changes with information about a potential outcome, then that would (surely?) mean there's no such thing as fate (which I know many people don't believe in anyway). 

More importantly though, and fate aside, it would mean there's no consequence. Time allows for actions to have consequence. 

The action of becoming pregnant leads to the consequence of (eventually) birth, and life. But being able to change the course of time means no consequence, or specifically, the consequence from the action no longer exists. 

And yet there is *some* consequence, so…what if the action of changing time was always the consequence, paradoxical as that sounds, but is just the same as fate. In that, I would have always lost my daughter, no matter how much I could change. 

But, would I change anything *if* I could?

I like to fantasise that Tia is alive in some sort of alternative reality. That she's happily part of our family. The five of us. 

But that's not this reality. And equally if she's alive in another reality, then stands to reason that she never existed in others. And that, never existing is worse.

I read a South Park quote (of all things):

> I'm sad […] The only way I can feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good. So I guess what I'm feeling is like a beautiful sadness.

It's easy to play with the idea of changing your past or your future, but now that I've lost something so important to me, I know, that I would never change it. I do it all again. 

Of course I want my daughter back. Of course I'd give anything for that, but I can't. I've got what I've got. 

I wouldn't change anything in time because I wouldn't risk loosing what I have already. My beautiful sadness.
