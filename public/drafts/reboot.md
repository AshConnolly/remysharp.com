# Reboot

The last year I've made a conscious effort to focus development efforts in JS Bin, and that's exactly what I did for over 8 months.

I had the great pleasure of hiring Giulia Alfonsi and Fabien O'Carroll. Giulia's contracted ended after 6 months and Fabien is now headed to greener pastures.

So now I have a 4 person office to myself. With that burning a hole in the business pocket, I've decided to completely reboot.

I'm shutting down the office and returning to solo working and surfing from coworking space to coffee shops.

## Disruption

I've spent the last three years (or more, I forget) working from an office space that I rented, so I've been out of this solo game for a while.

As always with my business, my personal life comes first (I've spent my 10 years where work came first), and so my biggest concern is maintaining my gym attendance and even more importantly: my diet (what I eat, rather than "dieting"). 

Disruption to routine is always a killer, so this is the thing I fear most, and I want to crack the routine quickly!

I usually work particularly well from home, but that was before kids, and so that's not really an option as I'd rather be with them than coding.

## Exciting opportunities
