About 4 years ago I got wind of an interesting project on Kickstarter: Sense. A beautifully made sleep sensor that would require no human interaction and work with ambient data to help track your quality of sleep.

The idea and project (certainly to me) was a clear winner, and closed on Kickstarter as one of those hugely invested projects. 

It delivered on it's basic premise and my Sense arrived with two "dots". The Sense would live in your bedroom picking up air quality, temperature, light and noise and the dot, would attach to my pillow and when the Sense detected it was dark enough (and I'd imagine late enough for bedtime) the dot would relay movement to then be interpreted as my quality of sleep.

I had originally backed the project for direct correlation to noise and quality of sleep, but this functionality never transpired.

However the kit is beautifully made and subtle enough that it doesn't intrude on the bedroom. 

But here's the rub: the core of the service, the *entire point* of the system lived on the web. Presumably the processing of data was too much for the on board chips in the Sense, or, I suspect the actual case: considered proprietary so it would be "protected" in the cloud. 

So, a little after 3 years when the Sense launched, the entire project has now been killed off. They couldn't raise more funds, or it was harder than they thought, I'm not sure, and frankly as an individual who **paid** for the product, I don't really care.

The end result, today when I took a look at my Sense report and the previous night's sleep: failed to collect enough data (a lie) and total DNS failure when hitting the help.

I now own perfectly functional hardware with, ironically, no software backend to do anything. This expensive, privileged bit of kid is now a totally useless dumb bit of kit. It was never sold as a dumb terminal, and had a product been, I think we'd all be bit more wary of purchasing them. 

So now I have to take this hardware to the tip (possibly drilling a few holes first as I've no idea what data is cached on the hardware).

When IoT puts a web service as the critical part of the system, the product will **always** eventually fail. On the web, we're constantly banging the drum for offline first, and yet now hardware is finding it's feet with the masses, we're forgetting long learned lessons.
