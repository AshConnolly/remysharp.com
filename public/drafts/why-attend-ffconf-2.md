# Reasons to attend ffconf #2: CSS-next!

[ffconf](https://ffconf.org) is created and run by myself and [Julie](https://twitter.com/julieanne), and my most important job is to curate very best content for the year. Each year is a challenge, but as the year progresses, I ask myself: what's important to the web, the way we work and how can we improve?

The sessions will make you and your business better from day to day. So why should you attend ffconf?

I've never personally been a huge fan of *having* to use build tools to make my JavaScript easier to manage as a developer, and certainly the same is true for CSS. Except, as it turns out, CSS has been quietly evolving whilst we've all been using post processors.

The **NEXT LEVEL CSS** session is going to show us exactly how far along CSS has come along. While we were all looking the other way browsers have been implementing CSS features that do things you might think you need JavaScript or at least a pre-processor to achieve. Weâ€™ll see what's landing in the CSS specifications and your browsers right now and in the very near future.
