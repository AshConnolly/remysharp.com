# The one where we did two days

The 2016 edition of [ffconf](https://ffconf.org) ran over two days. But it wasn't a two day event, it was a one day event, *run twice*. This was a thing that Julie and I had wanted to do since 2013.

The result has two very different experiences. I wanted to share both with you.

## A short backstory

When Julie and I launched tickets for ffconf 2013 something unexpected happened. The year before, we had sold out over a few hours, but this year was different. We sold out in a matter of minutes.

Instead of being overjoyed, Julie and I feltâ€¦gutted. We felt like we had let down the people who were still trying to buy tickets. We couldn't serve the demand and we felt guilty about it.

This is the first year that we discussed the possibility of running ffconf again. Except we felt like our reach had already peaked and we weren't confident that we could get the traction to sell a completely new day (let alone how it fit in with workshops etc). So instead, in 2013, we ran a new micro event named [Sideview](https://2013.ffconf.org/sideview). The event was a big success itself (it was made up exclusively of the CFPs, whereas ffconf is nearly entirely curated).

In 2014, our daughter, Seren was born. Julie had already run ffconf with a newborn, and the idea of running two ffconfs with a newborn was too silly to even consider.

In 2015 we actually booked a larger venue, one with a similar personality as our beautiful cinema, but were we could sell tiers, starting with 300, then up to 600 seats, all the way to 900 (but realistically we would have always capped at 600). However, in the week that we were supposed to sign the contract, the venue contacted us informing us that a larger event had booked the entire week and that they needed to take priority. So we stuck to one day.

In 2016, we took the plunge, and we ran ffconf twice.

## The event

As I write, ffconf was just last week for me. The venue was full and I always ask at the start of the event for attendees to raise their hands if this was their first time.

Both days, a sea of hands went up. This is super important to me, because it means that the conference is reaching more and more new people. Although on the flip side it means there's less "regulars", I think it's more important for a conference to reach new audiences, partly for sustainability, but also because I want to see new people learn from our event.

The second huge benefit of running twice was that we had a *lot more* availability for diversity seats. Our event is run by me and Julie, so we don't have the backing of a large company off the back of it. What this means is that it's part of our company's profit model. However, with a larger number of seats available, it meant we could make more seats available as non-profit (in actual fact they're at a loss since there's no money made from them).

I (personally) think it's important to write off some profits towards good causes. There's no money to be made, and we're far from raking in the cash, but whilst our company makes enough money to run happily, I think it's good karma to share some of that wealth back to individuals where it can make some kind of difference.

We had 30 diversity attendees, 10 of which we were able to pay for their travel and accommodation. This in part was supported by our [attendees too](https://2016.ffconf.org/#a-special-thanks-).

In general though, putting more effort in opening up our conference, and committing to diversity in both our content (speakers) and our attendees, tweets like this is what makes me personally happy beyond words and utterly inspired:

And it's kind of ridiculous that this following tweet was liked/fav'ed so much, but it's more that it was popular because it's a commentary on the state of tech events over the last few years (and hopefully changing):
