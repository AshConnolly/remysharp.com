# Reasons to attend ffconf #1: CI…CD…C*

[ffconf](https://ffconf.org) is created and run by myself and [Julie](https://twitter.com/julieanne), and my most important job is to curate very best content for the year. Each year is a challenge, but as the year progresses, I ask myself: what's important to the web, the way we work and how can we improve?

The sessions will make you and your business better from day to day. So why should you attend ffconf?

It's hard to know everything about the full process of releasing projects. For me, it's easy to come up with ideas and write code to bring it to life, but making the test, integration *and* deployment **continuous** is a lot of additional knowledge. Let alone know what the options are and which work best.

That's why **ALL THINGS CONTINUOUS** is a session at ffconf 2016 this year. Continuous Deployment for everybody: from a one-person army to distributed teams. Ecosystem appraisal, time-saving tips and maximum velocity!
