Unsure from where, but I feel that with each published long form post (if that's what you can call *this*), is the strong driving motiviation to make sure I get (at least) a single, sussinct message across. 

Something that has value to you the reader. Yet I own this content, and somehow I feel like I owe it somehow. That I have to turd out a perfect little ball of solid thought.

Why can't my thoughts be half formed, I'll advised or just a messy splodge of ideas?

I guess Twitter is kind of that place. As, I suspect, is Facebook status updates (though I left Facebook for personal stuff back in 2010, so it's entirely possible it's changed a tonne). But that's starting to change too. Bloggers are leaving Twitter for short form postings. 

Twitter has a sickness, or at least shows us how ill society is, and it's hard to feel rewarded for posting content there. Understandably though, I can imagine Twitter never intended to change the social platform in the way it has. 

So we bloggers return to our dusty blogs, and now what? I'm using to farting out 140 character brain bursts, not this longer and thought through stuff. Or at least I can blog as efficiently as I do tweet. 

So, this is that, that poorly communicated thought, almost entirely just practice at wordsâ€¦I guess.
