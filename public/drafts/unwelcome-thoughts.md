# Unwelcome thoughts

At night, typically when I'm alone with just my thoughts for company, those thoughts will bring back feelings of guilt and pain. I don't know why.

"Go home Remy. No one wants you here; nobody likes you Remy." 19 as I tried to leave the toilet in the pub, as he pinned me to the door.

I don't remember who he was, or how he related to me. I'm pretty sure I don't know any of these people now as an adult in my 40s, yet his words all too frequently drift into my mind offering nothing positive.

Whether it happened or not, my memory tells me that it punched him in the side of the head. It was a poor job of a punch. I've never punched anyone before. I've not since, and I'm not even sure I did that time. My memory, fabricated or not, tells me that it was shameful way to behave. In fact, all my memory from that time is awash in shame.

I was definitely drunk, and most likely causing a nuisance. Probably annoying or embarrassing my friends (or the people I thought were my friends), but his words were still cruel and hard, and they slice easily through time to reach me some 21 years later.

I'd been thinking about mental health this week, though my own mostly. I applaud those individuals who speak up and share of their troubles and how they've gone on to face down their own demons. I'm envious in fact. I know all the right things to say, all the positive messages and recognise the bad ones, yet I can't shake them out of my own head. I often face my demons but I also carry them around with me, letting them whisper their sweet nothings and lies into my ear.

I'm a different person to that version of me when I was 19. Unrecognisable from the outside and from my surroundings. I'm surrounded by sensible and caring adults that wouldn't be so raw and cruel as the children we start as. And yet those dark shadows follow me around. Unwelcome thoughts that all I can do is _try_ and push them back down.
