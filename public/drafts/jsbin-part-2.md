# The toxic side of free. Or how I lost £80,000 and my love for my side project

This is a story about JS Bin. I've told one story of jsbin before, and this is the b-side, the dark side. But remember with everything I share with you, jsbin is the longest running live pastebin, and it's not going anywhere. It will continue to run and serve its users. Even the scumbags.

## Fraud credit cards

Since we only charge £6 a month, its a nice low test for stolen credit cards to be tested with. Then there's the refund and the £15 processing fee. 

So I've taken to checking each and every individual sign up and their bins to see if they look spammy. I caught my first fraud card and reported on 13-April 2014. Not a huge success but very satisfying to know I've avoided the charge.
