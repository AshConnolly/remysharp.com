# My beef with Apple

## Why?

- Apple said "they're doing things differently" - Gruber 2010
- Apple don't care about the web. That's not the engineers or individual teams, but the general offering of the company does not care.
  o Bugs filed by the web community go to a black hole and aren't responded to
  o We have no visibility on future support of open technology, webrtc for instance
  o Accountability along with other browser vendors - *never* openly talk
  o Evangelists are not allowed to join the open conversations
  o Perception is they do their own thing without listening to the needs of developers - whether that's true or not, it's the perception that we have. Experts might know differently, but the majority of the web community chalk apple's (lack of) involvement as "that's just apple"

## What do I want to see?

- Developer relations that can be present at conferences outside of Apple.
- Questions about interest and intended support for W3C technology can be answered.
