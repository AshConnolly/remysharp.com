# A bit of a cheatsheet

1 bit: a bit. a single binary value. wires in computers have an on or off value, and thus binary is whether the wire is on or off. [More here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/how-computers-work2/v/khan-academy-and-codeorg-binary-data)

4 bits: a nibble. 4 bits - god knows when this is useful, 0xF or 0b1111
- aka: nyble, half-byte, tetrade

8 bits: a byte. if you're looking at a hex value, it will be 0xFF - two `F` (two nibbles I guess).
- aka: octet, char (see explanation for "word" below)

16 bits: a word.
