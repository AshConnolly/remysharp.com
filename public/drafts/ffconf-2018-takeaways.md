# ffconf personal take aways

This an unexhaustive list of single take aways from each talk from ffconf last week. Whilst I remember:

1. Jo Franchetti on "Mentoring: being the help you wish you'd had"

> Someone takes the time to give you criticism, they believe you'll do the right thing with it.

2. AI

> First that machine learning works with numbers, and those numbers represent success. Secondly there's a tonne of pretrained datasets available
