# Why I love working with the web

> Easy is boring. That's why I love the web and browsers […]

I love that my code can run anywhere for anyone. Indeed that's the challenge. The web is a hugely diverse environment anyone view anything anyway they want.

If the viewer is using the latest technology beefy desktop computer that's great. Equally they could view the website from a work computer, something old and locked in using a browser called IE8.

Douglas Crockford once famously said:

You're damn right it is. And it's with that hostility that allows me access to the world. It's that hostility that I call my daily challenge.

This hostile environment is what gets me excited. That challenge of getting my page to render everywhere. Getting the code just right so that it progressively enhances so that everyone can view the page.

I'm not saying that I achieve it every time. For example, I've strived to make jsbin.com work in IE7 and IE8 for many years, and somewhere along the line, we lost IE8 support (which I'll try to find time to fix one day too).
