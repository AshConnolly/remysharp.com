# Why I love working with the web

- The code required to run on the web is text. I wrote some of my first web sites using a £25 PC I bought at computer fair. I went to a news agents, bought a magazine that had a copy of IE3, wrote, in Notepad.exe, one of my first web sites. No compilers required.
- Browsers are incredibly tollerant of errors. This is amazing because anyone can hatchet together some simple markup and *make something* - even if it includes "errors" in the code.
- Once something I've written is on the web, it's accessible by *everyone* that has access to the web. It's not a shop or physical product that has limititations in location or distribution.
- There are so many different ways of achieving the same result with the web stack. None are *right*, none are *wrong*.
- Making a *thing* is, IMHO, incredibly empowering. Not only does it give a sense of pride, but it also pulls down the barriers between what you're capable of and what the "big corporations" are capbable of, in that *it's just code*.

The web to me, is about *access*. Discovery comes very quickly after access - since I can use a web site like Google to discover just about anything. But equally, I can read a friend's blog post, and with an incredibly simple amount of code, I can discover something new:

```html
<a href="http://www.something-new.com">Something new</a>
```

The simplicity of HTML lends itself beautifully to blanket copy and pasting without requiring knowledge of what you're doing - but it actually just works.



I love that my code can run anywhere for anyone. Indeed that's the challenge. The web is a hugely diverse environment anyone view anything anyway they want.

If the viewer is using the latest technology beefy desktop computer that's great. Equally they could view the website from a work computer, something old and locked in using a browser called IE8.

Douglas Crockford once famously said:

> The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.

You're damn right it is. And it's with that hostility that allows me access to the world. It's that hostility that I call my daily challenge.

This hostile environment is what gets me excited. That challenge of getting my page to render everywhere. Getting the code just right so that it progressively enhances so that everyone can view the page.

I'm not saying that I achieve it every time. For example, I've strived to make jsbin.com work in IE7 and IE8 for many years, and somewhere along the line, we lost IE8 support (which I'll try to find time to fix one day too).



Do *you* love working on the web? Why?
