In our crusade to recreate the [world's first browser](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/) the question of how search came up.

It's an interesting problem because the context for those days, 1989-1990, was that: the web had just been invented/proposed, the first http daemon had been written (and published) and the first browser had been written: WorldWideWeb.

For search to work, there would have to be an agreement between all three: the servers, HTML and the browser parsing the HTML.

So `<ISINDEX>` was used. This post looks at how it worked, where it faded out, and how, today, we actually have a very close descendant that is alive and well.
