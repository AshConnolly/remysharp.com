# On my Pebble

Back in 2013 I joined the bandwagon and backed the hyped kickerstarter campaign for the very first Pebble.

After waiting way way too long and abandoning my original choice for an orange watch I was forced to choose the black, only to get my hands on it earlier.

I also hadn't worn a watch in well over 15 years. I'm not 100% what prompted me to buy the watch. Perhaps the promise of an open source platformâ€¦?

When it arrived, what I noticed immediately was that it was massive on my wrist. The strap was particularly large and never really felt snug.

I figured it would last 3 months on my wrist.

## What's the point?

The Pebble gave me one important (to me) feature. Text messages (and calls) would vibrate on my wrist.

I'd found that when I was away from home, I'd nearly always miss text messages from my wife. Even when my phone was on vibrate and loud, I'd still miss them.

A small vibration on my wrist would *subtlety* alert me to something I could decide to action or not. For me, this was a big deal and an important feature.

For the first 3 months it was a novelty. I kept reading about cool apps that could do text responses - but alas I was using an iPhone and none of this functionality was available to my phone.

The first turning point to my unimpressed state was spending 1 month trailing a move to Android.

This experience totally opened up the Pebble's functionality to me. 

Eventually I returned to my iPhone and my Pebble went back to a watch with a handful of notifications.

So, why and how am I still wearing my Pebble today?

## My Pebble today

Some 18 months later I still wear my Pebble. It helps that I finally ditched my iPhone for an Android (a OnePlus One - and that's another blog post).

The strap has broken, it needs charging once a week (insane if you compare to a regular watch) and the bottom right action button (1 out of 4 buttons) is playing up. Sounds fairly bad? So *why* am I still wearing it??!

I've customised it, and that's made it *my* watch.

## Customisations

### Watchface

I'd tried in the past to make my own watch face but failed pretty hard. But then my second attempt took an existing [watchface]() and made [my own]() modifications, including using a custom font. 

### JavaScript apps

Although there's a couple of limitations in the JS apps, the simple fact is: I can create my ideas as JavaScript based Pebble apps in a matter of hours.

I recently wrote a quick interface to a local bus time webapp that I wrote. Now from my wrist, in a few presses I have the bus times on my wrist. 

From a practical use, this is actually easier than using my phone because it takes a few seconds to do the geo-lookup and then request the content from the bus website, so when I'm rushing around in the morning, I don't have to mess around with my phone.

I also wrote a simple prototype with a Spark that I could control LEDs from my watch. Pointless, but cool.

### C apps

The *reason* the button is failing on my Pebble is because I use it so much.

I wrote a C based app that I use in the gym to time my rests between sets.

Its simple. No animations, no nonsense. Three preset (configurable) times in seconds, and a timer.

I'm in the gym 4 times a week, and usually have around 20-25 sets. I use my app between *every* set. Its spot on perfect for what I want to do.
