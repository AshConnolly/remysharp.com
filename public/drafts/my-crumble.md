# My Crumbling Building

Dear future Remy: this post is for. A reminder.

In October I hurt my lower back. I was deadlifting. A good solid warm up from 60kg, 80, 100, 120 and 140kg. Then my working weight of 160. Aiming for 8 reps, but I got 5. Previously my PB was 170kg x 3 (I weigh 72kg).

So I decided to do a superset on 140. I pulled. It didn't budge. So, obviously, I pulled harder and my back got hurt. A tear in my lower disc.

It hurt *real* bad. There were strange noises and I couldn't bend over, at all. I imposed a 3 months ban on big-ish moves (deadlift, squats, bentover row, t-bar row) and spent a decent amount of time with a chiropractor, who mostly massaged and advised me on excersise. It got "better".

## Deadlifts are my weakness

Out of all the work I do at the gym, my favourite thing is deadlifting. It's such a simple but strong move. It's me vs. gravity. No competing against anyone else. Just me, alone, trying to lift a heavy ass weight. The kind of challenge I like.

Except I now have a weak point in my back. Like a weak joint in a building, if too much pressure is applied to that same spot, it's the first thing to break.

And it did.

## On being invincible

This week I squatted 125kg x 5 and something felt wrong. My back again. My form was good, but obviously something was up.

My back is not okay. I'm not quite back at square one, but I need to acknowledge to myself that I'm not invincible, nor will I *ever* fully repair. Ever.

I look at my body like a machine. One I have control of. When I programme, I understand the problem, and either work around it, fix it, or refactor so it becomes a non issue. I understand my systems and I can fix anything (or so I'll tell myself).

Except my body isn't a fully known system. There's *so* many variables that I'm not aware of. There's so much I can't see.

I can't fix everything. I'll never fully understand *or* control my body. I barely want to believe that.

# Decide: longevity or desire

It's insane that I should even consider trying to deadlift again. But I want to.
