# Why Attend ffconf #6: PWA

If you don't know what a progressive web app (PWA) is, you need to attend right now. If you do, you should attend too, because I believe progressive web apps are one of the biggest and more important steps forward for the web.

The idea brings together a lot of new technologies whilst enforcing a secure and progressive enhancement approach to software development.

If done well, we, as web developers can secure the experience for web users and show those people how powerful the web is without them having to ever opt-in, by a new phone or install a new operating system: it just works.

I'm was extremely keen to have a session on progressive web apps so that you can not only learn, but take this knowledge back to your day to day work and inspire others that you work with.
