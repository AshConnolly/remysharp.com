# Code highlighting: server or client?

Recently I posted a [quick poll](https://mobile.twitter.com/rem/status/1112821258259922950) to Twitter asking:

> Do you think syntax highlighting (in blog posts, examples, etc) be in client side or server side?

Though I favour client side (I'll come on to my reasons in a bit), I was surprised at the results being around 2/3rds preferring client side. So I decided to look at my own blog posts to see what would suit my system best.

- Rendering
- Downstream
- Complexity
- Browser required for some plugins
- Worked initially, but missed some languages and not clear how it doesn't work
- Highlighters written with a DOM in mind, so install instructions often lean this way
