# # 10: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday of March!

Good gosh this year is flying by it seems! I feel like I've been pretty busy with the computer, almost to my own detriment. In fact, most nights this month have been 2-3 hours after my normal bedtime tinkering on the laptop. So my strategy this long weekend (I've got Friday and Monday off work) is to hide the laptop from myself #hashtag-no-self-control.

**Projects**

I've been a busy bunny (and a tired bunny), this month I've been working on a lot of different projects, in addition to my day work.

**Serverless:** I've been experimenting with cloud function based applications, I took a brief look at serverless, but am digging much deeper in to Brian LeRoux's (of PhoneGap fame) [.Architect](https://arc.codes/) framework. I'm keeping notes of my progress and problems and hope to share later this year.

**Video tutorials:** I've (re) recorded over 3 hours of video material for a Universal JavaScript with Next.js online course. I'll email this list about it as it's released (with a reader's discount). [Some vague details here](https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/239554?v=7) [details here](https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/239554?v=7).

**Hardware:** discovering pimoroni.com - I've gone into a bit of a over the top buying frenzy for tiny hardware. I bought a Micro:bit which are so cool - I managed to [write a game for my kids](https://twitter.com/rem/status/972608006989983744) in a matter of minutes.

**On the blog**

My primary use for my blog has always been a diary/reminder tool, so when I was asked about how I decided to name my company (not for the first time), I decided to write up [what thinking went into the process](https://remysharp.com/2018/03/29/why-i-have-a-limited-company).

If you do any Node development, then I've got to assume you've needed to debug more than once. [Here's a trick for turning on the debug inspector](https://remysharp.com/2018/03/03/last-minute-node-debugging) _on an existing running process_. This trick has saved my bacon on multiple occasions.

I also sent out a newsletter to the people who bought my terminal.training with a really neat tip for quickly [changing the entire theme of your terminal in a single command](https://ckarchive.com/b/5quvh7h08vnv).

**Monthly recommend**

At the start of the month I attended jsconf.is - and sure there's some _cool_ talks, but my favourite talk was [on mental health in the workplace](https://youtu.be/4P_kJGmJGyw?t=3h52m14s). This talk was full of data and useful advice for companies large and small.

During my visit I managed to get a trip out to see the Northern Lights‚Ä¶and actually saw them - so I'd recommend that too (with an SLR and some warm clothes) üòâ
