# # 24: Remy's b:logHappy last Friday of May, satisfyingly landing on the actual last day of May üí™

I write this as I make my way to the [last jsconf.eu](https://2019.jsconf.eu/an-update/) - number 10, or 'X'. I've had the great pleasure of speaking at the first jsconf.eu, one (‚Ä¶or two‚Ä¶?) in the middle and [closed out last year's event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3MNdxQFUe8). The conference has a very special place in my heart and if you're going along too, I hope you have a great time.

For me it's been a busy month, my blogging has gone a little overdrive and I've completed two fully working side projects (more on this later‚Ä¶I suspect!).

On the blog
-----------

The focus of my posts very much continue to be advancing my static site features.

Firstly it was important to support "shortcut links" on my blog (so that I could navigate to remysharp.com slash twitter - and it would jump to the latest post matching "twitter" in the slug). Secondly was the ability to search (I know Angolia is a great 3rd party solution here, but I also knew I could code my own solution).

[Search & dynamic shortcut links for a static site](https://remysharp.com/2019/05/02/search-dynamic-shortcut-links) goes into detail on how to pull terms out of static files and create a responsive JavaScript search with some basic algorithmic weighting logic.

In an attempt to rid myself of Google Analytics, I've been looking at [Goaccess](https://goaccess.io) and I found that there were certain tricks to get Netlify to allow me to [access AWS credentials](https://remysharp.com/2019/05/18/aws-inside-netlify) and how to [compile binaries](https://remysharp.com/2019/05/20/compiling-binaries-for-netlify) _specifically_ for Netlify images. The result is statically driven (public access) logs:

And now for something completely different, here's [the story of how my front teeth](https://remysharp.com/2019/05/21/all-i-want-for-christmas) got smashed out and the fun last 12 months I've had getting them back üòÅ

Monthly recommend
-----------------

Some of these might not be new, but I've found them exceptionally useful.

*   **[Firefox's send](https://send.firefox.com)** service (and an accompanying [command line tool](https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend)). It's one I've been passing on to my non-technical family and friend.
*   **[Updown.io](https://updown.io/r/tx47y)** a monitoring & notification service I rely on for 10 different websites. The pricing is superb (disclaimer: the link is a referral link - you'll get 100K credits and I get 100K if you go on to buy credit) and making uptime public is [super easy](https://status.jsbin.com).
*   **[Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/explain/1/find)** an interesting interface to help grok how command line tools work and what their arguments mean. Probably useful if you're not 100% sure what's about to happen.

My bits
-------

I've got a few ways that you can support my writing, code and work.

*   Learn from my courses: [Learn the Command Line](https://terminal.training/?coupon=SUBSCRIBER&utm_source=email&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=newsletter-discount) and [Mastering universal React with Next.js](http://next.training.leftlogic.com/?coupon=SUBSCRIBER&utm_source=email&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=newsletter-discount) (both available with a 50% discount using "SUBSCRIBER")
*   Software: [jqterm for Mac](https://gum.co/jqterm) - a desktop copy of jqterm.com (which I personally use on a weekly basis) - pick your own price starting at ‚Ç¨5 (I use this tool on a near-daily basis)

Thanks for reading and I'll speak to you again in June,
