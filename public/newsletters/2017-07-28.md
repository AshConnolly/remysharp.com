# # 2: Remy's b:logHappy last Friday of July!

This month's big moment for me has been the launch of the [9th edition of ffconf](https://ffconf.org). Each year I'm super nervous with the growing amount of existing events and Brexit having a direct impact on company training budgets it's all a bit of a mess. But! The launch went really well, and we sold Friday out within 24 hours ðŸŽ‰

If you want to be involved there's still time to grab a Thursday ticket or even a deep dive masterclass with me on Next.js or even Angular 5.0 with Gerard Sans. A few things you can do:

*   Check out the [sessions](https://2017.ffconf.org/sessions)
*   Share the [diversity scholarship](https://2017.ffconf.org/scholarship) with friends and colleagues
*   Take a look at our masterclasses on [Next.js](https://2017.ffconf.org/workshop-next) and [Angular](https://2017.ffconf.org/workshop-angular)
*   [Buy a ticket for yourself, or donate a ticket to our scholarship](http://buytickets.at/ffconf2017)
*   Gawk at how bad the [source code](https://github.com/leftlogic/ffconf2017) is!

**On the blog**

Probably the blog post with the most interest this month has been my revisiting Windows after using a Mac for well over a decade now. I'm still in the process of getting my development workflow right, but I wrote up a [lengthy post on my opinion of the Surface Book](https://remysharp.com/2017/07/11/opening-windows-again-part-1) hardware. **TL;DR:** it's (surprisingly) pretty nice.

**Reactish**

If you've followed my work, I've always been a bit _anti_ frameworksâ€¦I can't honestly say if I had good reason, but in the last year I've worked more and more with React and enjoying it.

I've got a long-post out early next month for people like me who resist these frameworks, and I've even started a video course on Next.js which is, what I'd called, **zero configuration** universal React apps. [If you're interested in learning more, you can here](https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/239554?v=6).

**Monthly recommend**

If you're working for yourself or have to bill clients, I read Jonathan Stark's _[Hour Billing Is Nuts](https://expensiveproblem.com/hbin?ref=remysharp)_ and although the price point feels a bit high for a book, it's totally worth every penny and packed with really good advice and suggestions. Jonathan also runs a daily (!!!) email list which I think I've read nearly every one that comes in, so again, I'd recommend that too.

If you've got any great thing to recommend, please hit reply and let me know - I'm always on the lookout on making my working life a little easier!

Thanks for reading, and have a super weekend.
