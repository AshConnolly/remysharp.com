# #27: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday of August.

August, for me, as it will always be, is a hard month. I wrote about how our first born daughter would have had her [ninth](http://localhost:9000/2019/08/24/the-ninth-august) birthday, but doesn't and never will (_cw: stillbirth_). To top off the emotional lows, one of our cats died at the end of July, we found him in in the garden, he was 14.

My partner and I have taken this week off work and I've tried mostly to keep offline just to give ourselves a little head space. It's good. It's lonely. But for me, it reminds me that it's the people around us that make life real.

## On the blog

Aside from my two personal posts on Tia's [not-ninth](http://localhost:9000/2019/08/24/the-ninth-august) and [Ninja passing away](https://remysharp.com/2019/07/31/ninja) I had a bit of (another) spurt of technical posts.

- **[Predictably Random](https://remysharp.com/2019/08/06/predictably-random)** - wherein I talk about seeding random numbers, and reddit commenter's decide to call me amateurish (I liked the _ish_ bit üòÅ)
- **[An fd trick](https://remysharp.com/2019/08/13/fd-trick)** - `fd` is a really useful command line tool (an alternative to `find`) and in this post I use it to do a mass git rename process.
- **[Build free code & testing ES module imports](https://remysharp.com/2019/08/16/build-free-code-and-testing-es-module-imports)** - I talk about how I'm (finally) able to use ES module import statements without any build tools in my node based projects both in my code and in my tests.

I also released an update to my blog so that it now works offline, and I'll be writing up a few tricks I'm using, my favourite of which is the offline-recently-visited page:

## Monthly recommend

Another book. In the last few months I've been reading the news üò≠ plus my own sad news, and then reading [The Three-Bodied Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem) (and it's [sequel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest)) and then watching [Years and Years](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000539g/years-and-years) (excellent, on BBC iPlayer) so my current view on everything was super super bleak.

I asked for a recommendation that was: _"Fiction, light hearted, fun, lovely. i.e. Antithesis of brexit/current twitter/years & years"_

One such recommendation was **Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day**. Oh, my, gosh: it was perfect. It's absolutely 100% happy. I literally smiled all throughout reading this book.

So if you want a book that's happy and a total break to the bleak outlook of the current social and political climate then [I highly recommend this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22747134-miss-pettigrew-lives-for-a-day).
