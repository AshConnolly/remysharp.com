# # 1: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday of June!

I'm still working out the format for this newsletter, but I wanted to share a few recent updates.

If you're interested in sticky navigation and solid UX, I posted a 3 part series on how I approached this:

1.  [Sticky headers](https://remysharp.com/2017/06/28/sticky-headers)
2.  [Sticker headers with smooth scrolling](https://remysharp.com/2017/06/29/smooth-scroll-with-sticky-nav)
3.  [As above, without any JavaScript](https://remysharp.com/2017/06/29/css-sticky-nav-and-smooth-scroll)

Secondly, I've launched a free command line mini course to complement my Terminal Training videos. You can get this course for [**free by clicking here**](https://terminal.training/thanks.html).

Finally, I've launched the [ffconf 2017](https://2017.ffconf.org) conference web site in a glorious ZX Spectrum theme! Sessions, CFP and scholarships are open, and tickets go live on 20 July. Check it out and I hope to see some of you there.

Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend.

â€“ Remy
