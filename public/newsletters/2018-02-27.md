# # 9: Remy's b:log

Happy (not) last Friday of February!

Yes, sorry, late. But in my defence, Feb is a weird month, 28 days, shorter than most, then sometimes 29‚Ä¶it's a confusing one.

It's likely you got one of my emails a few weeks ago about a flash sale on [terminal.training](https://terminal.training) - so my following weeks have been all about the terminal and tooling related to the terminal.

I've been preparing a blog post about alternative command line defaults. I mentioned jq last month (which I'll come back to in a moment), but one of my _favourite_ CLI alternatives is [`prettyping`](https://github.com/denilsonsa/prettyping), it makes pinging a site, even when it's down, rather cool:

I've got ping set up with `alias ping='prettyping --nolegend'`

**What about you?** **Any alternative defaults you use?**

**On the blog**

Keeping with my command line theme, I wrote up how to get started with a Raspberry PI Zero without a keyboard mouse or display. I think the PI Zeros are amazingly cheap, but having to get it started connected to a screen was a pain.

**Digging into jq**

It seems that I'm more and more interested in JSON mapping and manipulation. With [jqterm](https://jqterm.com) last month, and more [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) fun, I started investigating alternatives to jq (since the syntax can _sometimes_ be a bit fiddly). I found two: lobar and jq.node. They're not without their merits, but when I ran a simple timing test on the command line, I could see quite quickly that "vanilla" jq wins hands down:

If you're looking at the screenshot above, I've use the `time` command to get the system timing of how long the process took to complete. jqn is [jq.node](https://github.com/FGRibreau/jq.node), lbr is [lobar](https://github.com/sodiumjoe/lobar) and jq is‚Ä¶jq. The efficiency of jq is massive, and though I'm looking at fairly tiny numbers, there's a noticeable lag on jq.node returning. So it's useful to test out timings and test out alternatives when you spend a lot of time in the command line!

**Monthly recommend**

Another viewing recommendation. I discovered [Dirk Gently](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently%27s_Holistic_Detective_Agency_(TV_series)) on Netflix. Really enjoyed it (and yes, somehow I managed to finished two series in a month). A blast of colours, sounds, images and general fun and weird weirdness. Based on Douglas Adams' book by the same title, even has me wanting to read the books (if I didn't already [have a to-read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/63680802-remy-sharp?shelf=to-read) list of almost 30 books for this year!!!).
