# # 12: Remy's b:log

Happy GDPR-OH-MY-GOD-WILL-IT-END weekend!

For those of you that have followed this newsletter for a while will know two things: 1) this email is late and should have arrived last Fridayâ€¦ (sorry!), 2) I'm heavily into my ZX Spectrums (apparently distributed as Timex internationally) - I've even shared a few links to my rambling projects. So that's (the Spectrum) has been nearly all my personal focus lately.

**Projects**

Then a few months back, I submitted a CFP to jsconf.eu mostly expecting to fall to the wayside â€“ but then got accepted, and now that I've got the schedule, I'm finishing up the entire event when the entire attendance of 1,200 joins the single track. Soâ€¦no pressure!

Anyway, I've turned some massive milestones this weekend, and learnt a tonne of stuff from what's been just over 12 months of tinkering. The biggest win this weekend was working out how to encode a full audio stream with enough information to get an original 1982 ZX Spectrum to load an image I've generated in a browser.

Yes, I'm an uber geek. Yes, that's a original 1982 ZX Spectrum rendering raw data generated from my laptop **entirely** in a browser, and yes, I will _try_ to write it up on my blog!

If you're interested in any of the extra detail, just hit reply and I'll try to send some links and bits - otherwise I'm sure the video from the event (this coming weekend) will be released and I'll be able to share, but there's still a tonne of (â€¦useless?!) information I've learnt that I won't be able to squeeze into 25 minutes.

**On the blog**

My blog has been a bit of a range of posts. Most recently my Kindle diedâ€¦and [I got kinda emotional about it](https://remysharp.com/2018/05/18/my-extinguished-kindle), which was weird (but then [Tim Kadlec also got emotion](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-05-18-ode-to-the-kindle/), so I felt "normal" again!). It makes me realise that technology is fast becoming an extension of our selves.

If you live in the command line, like I do, then you might like my [copy and paste commands](https://remysharp.com/2018/04/25/how-i-copy-paste-in-the-terminal) that make command line copying and pasting a little more intuitiveâ€¦IMHO!

Finally, a little trick I use in some of my node modules to make [testing from the command line easy to invoke](https://remysharp.com/2018/04/12/quick-tip-for-node-modules).

**Monthly recommend**

Something a little different. I've been trying a ketogenic diet for the last few months, and there's one little bit of food that I love, and it's nothing but good for you. It's called a Cheesy Cloud Biscuits.

[![](https://convertkit.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pictures/40116/1307387/content_cloud-biscuit.jpg)](https://gist.github.com/remy/0990722b4a1f4003cf3f849c36f9fcf9)

It's main ingredients are almond flour, cheese (cheddar and soft cheese) and salmon - and it's super tasty (and filling).

[Here's the recipe](https://gist.github.com/remy/0990722b4a1f4003cf3f849c36f9fcf9) (I'll have this every week or other week - yum!).

Until June, enjoy the sun (caveat: at time of writing there's a massive downpour!),
