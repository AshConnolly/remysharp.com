# # 6: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday of November! (AKA Happy buy-random-shit-on-the-web-friday)

Wow, was November a busy month! Julie (my partner) and I have rounded off ffconf for the 9th year (NINE YEARS?! ðŸ˜±) a couple of weeks ago. Somehow it managed to be huge success again. I'm in the process of uploading videos to youtube (10s of GBs) and they'll be released on the [@ffconf](https://twitter.com/ffconf) twitter account - the talks were a-maze-zing.

**On the blog**

When I started out attending conferences I'd always write up my experience, in fact, here's [FOWA](https://remysharp.com/2007/10/03/fowa-2007) (if anyone remembers that) from 10 years ago! So this year, I wrote up my own experience of ffconf - but not from the organiser POV, but as an attendee (particularly as I get to see it twice): [Thoughts and learning from ffconf](https://remysharp.com/2017/11/17/thoughts-and-learning-from-ffconf-2017)

Following with my crazed obsession with 1980s computing and rebuilding ZX Spectrum toys, I've written up how to [get binary values for numbers](https://remysharp.com/2017/11/24/binary-strings) "properly", and if you want to see what this was all for, here's a [sneak peek](https://zx.isthe.link/?speccy).

Visit the link above in a desktop browser (it won't work on a mobile phone), then type: enter, then J (it should read "LOAD " now), then in double quotes, your twitter handle, so it would read LOAD "rem" - then hit enter and put your volume around 30%!). It shouldâ€¦load your twitter avatar and dither it in 8 bit "attribute clash" styled graphics, and play the binary audio which is used to render the image on the screen. Let me know what you think! ðŸ˜ƒ

**Monthly recommend**

Given that it's Black Friday weekend, I thought I'd share a few deals I've come across:

*   [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/vpn-cyber-deal/) are offering a 3 year VPN for $99 - and their UX is really nice for both mobile and desktop
*   Alternatively, there's [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/) which I've used for about 18 months, they're offering 1 year of VPN for â‚¬35
*   My own [terminal.training](https://terminal.training?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=black-friday) video course is available at 30% off this weekend (ignore the countdown!)
*   For those developers who struggling with marketing (certainly I do), there's [Marketing for Developers](https://devmarketing.xyz/?utm_source=remys-blog&utm_medium=newsletter) for $149 (not totally sure if that's for this weekend or not, but I bought this at full price about 9 months ago and definitely recommend it).

* * *

Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend folks!
