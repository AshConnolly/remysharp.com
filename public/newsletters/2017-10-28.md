# # 5: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday…Saturday of October! 🎃👻

Five editions out and I've already missed my own self imposed deadline!

October has been a bit of a weird month. My family had to say goodbye to our 12 year old cat who very suddenly became ill. Super, super sad. I also took a bit of a break from Twitter which I _think_ only resulted in me not hearing about the terrible stuff Trump was up to that particular day 😒, but pulling the plug on Twitter was actually,unsurprisinglyy, a fairly healthy experience.

**On the blog** (sorta…!)

*   I spoke at [Paris Web](https://www.paris-web.fr/2017/conferences/) earlier this month giving a talk about recreating a ZX Spectrum loading process. Not my best talk, and I still want to write it all up and refine the actual content. Amazing event though, really strong on the accessibility too.
*   Published my favourite patterns in [ES6 default arguments](https://remysharp.com/2017/10/25/es6-default-arguments) (TL;DR: they're fun!)
*   Then with all the ZX work I've done, I built a tool to visualise the impact of binary operations: [http://bitcalc.isthe.link](http://bitcalc.isthe.link/)

**Monthly recommend**

Bit heavier suggetion this week. I read an \[excellent post on patriarchy\](http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/minimization-patriarchal-reflex/) late last night. A quote of a quote from the post:

_“The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an inpidual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.”_

Heavy and impactful reading.

**Next month**

November is right around the corner, and for the house of Sharp, it's all [ffconf](https://ffconf.org) - if you're in the UK, do come [**join us for £179+vat**](https://ffconf.org/tickets).

Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend folks!
