# # 4: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday of September!

In fact, today is my son's birthday, so it's fairly manic at Chez Sharp today - particularly with the presence of a minion fart gun!

This month conference season has begun, and although I've spent a couple of years dialing the talks down, I gave a talk earlier this month and will be giving it again for [Paris Web](https://www.paris-web.fr/2017/conferences/) next month. The talk was a step into the past on how I've been working (entirely for fun) to recreate the 1980's cassette loading process - which is mostly a screeching sound with psychedelic colours.

Of course, it's a little more than that, and I talk about what I learnt along the way (I expect it'll end up a blog post eventually), but if you're interested, this is the (near) final effect whereby my software is _listening_ to the audio and translating it to an image:

**On the blog**

So, not much this month (unless I manage to bang out a new post this weekend…which I doubt). I wrote about a bit of bitwise rabbit hole I fell down (in fact, for the project I mentioned earlier). If you're interested in geeking out about JavaScript numbers, and bit operations, then take a look at [my dive into bitwise not and numbers](https://remysharp.com/2017/09/08/dive-into-bitwise-not-and-numbers)[](https://remysharp.com/2017/09/08/dive-into-bitwise-not-and-numbers).



**Monthly recommend**

For fun, check out the [gitmoji cli tool](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) - it will let you add a consistent set of emoji as part of your commits, and we all know you're instantly cool if you use emoji everywhere… 😀😂😍😎😵🙀💂👋🐂🐌🍼⏰🤷 (something like that 😉)

For security, if you're a user of iTerm (I am, and tend to recommend it everywhere), then there's an important security update you should install if you haven't already: [update to 3.1.1](https://www.iterm2.com/news.html) (background reading [here](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/dnslookupissue)).



**Finally**

I'm running a [**workshop on Universal React using Next.js**](https://2017.ffconf.org/workshop-next) in November as part of ffconf. If you're in the UK, and use any of these technologies, I'd love to see you come along (there's also a few Thursday tickets to the event alone available).

Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend folks!
