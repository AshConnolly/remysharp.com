# # 22: Remy's b:log

Happy last Friday of March! And happy Brexit day‚Ä¶apparently‚Ä¶

Oh wow, the UK's political system is rather in a shambles right now! Never mind, there's chocolate eggs out in the supermarkets for 99p and spring has finally arrived üéâ

So ends Q1 and starts Q2 of 2019. Is there anything you're particularly proud of from Q1? I think for me, it'll be the [WorldWideWeb CERN project](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch).

All about the blog
------------------

During a quiet Saturday afternoon (my partner and kids were out on a day trip), I decided it would be "fun" to completely rewrite my blog from scratch taking large inspiration from [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/). I did consider Hugo (and use it for the jsbin blog), and I've used [**Next.js**](https://next.training.leftlogic.com/?coupon=SUBSCRIBER) (_üëà that's 50% discounted link to my course_) for a number of static site which I _really_ like, and I dabbled with GatsbyJS - but being a tinkerer I saw drawn to writing something of my own.

With a few more hours stolen in the evenings, I successfully released the new software this morning with zero hiccups.

I'm going to write a few posts on the details, but here's some of the highlights:

*   Moved from a paid Heroku instance to a free Netlify account
*   Deploy process is faster
*   300+mb of image links _still_ work and are hosted as part of Netlify, whilst not impacting on the deploy time
*   I removed Twitter's tracking code whilst keeping the feature of "@rem has X number of followers"
*   Removed a dynamic server and still support it's functionality from the client
*   Removed jQuery as a client side dependency

I've been trying out a [**weekly Twitch**](https://www.twitch.tv/remysharp) sessions of 60 minutes, and this week I streamed the process of removing jQuery (not because I don't like jQuery, I still ‚ù§Ô∏è it) which you can [watch again on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dgU68gJUtMQ) if you want.

My next plans with the blog are:

*   Remove disqus and replace with (something) like https://commento.io
*   Remove Google Analytics and replace with (again, something like) https://matomo.org
*   Investigae if there's a way I can get my drafts from dropbox to auto-deploy without having to push to github (not so sure about this)

The code is [all in github](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/tree/master/lib) too if you want a gander.

Monthly recommend
-----------------

If you're a developer like me who knows good design, but can't produce it for love nor money, then you might like this. Sara Soueidan recommended it on Twitter: a (ready to go) design system for Sketch - with directions on how to customise: **[https://cabanadesignsystem.com](https://cabanadesignsystem.com?ref=remysharp)** (it's $48 which even for a small business like mine is a bargain).

Happy hacking!

My bits
-------

I've got a few ways that you can support my writing, code and work.

*   Learn from my courses: [Learn the Command Line](https://terminal.training/?coupon=SUBSCRIBER&utm_source=email&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=newsletter-discount) and [Mastering universal React with Next.js](http://next.training.leftlogic.com/?coupon=SUBSCRIBER&utm_source=email&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=newsletter-discount) (both available with a 50% discount using "SUBSCRIBER")
*   Software: [jqterm for Mac](https://gum.co/jqterm) - a desktop copy of jqterm.com (which I personally use on a weekly basis) - pick your own price starting at ‚Ç¨5 (I use this tool on a near-daily basis)

Thanks for reading and I'll speak to you again in April,
