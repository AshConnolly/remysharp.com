</div><article class="post"><header class="post-header"><h2 class="title"><a href="/2015/12/31/my-2015">Latest: My 2015</a></h2></header><section class="post-excerpt post-content"><p>I&#39;ve been writing these end of year accounts since 2009, so I continue to do so, and as always, these are primarily for future me - so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll forgive the post for being overly ra-ra-me!</p>
<h2>Work</h2><p>At the start of the year, I <a href="/2015/01/05/reboot">rebooted</a> and returned to (effectively) a one-man code shop (although in reality both Julie and I run the business, I just do the coding part). My team had moved on, and I&#39;d give up the office by January returning to working out of my trusty kitchen (where I actually work pretty well).</p>
<p>Although my biggest concern was finding new work after having nearly zero client work in 2014, it somehow turned out okay.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had the pleasure of working with local company <a href="http://brilliantnoise.com/">Brilliant Noise</a> and Martin Edwards and was responsible for building the node.js backend to their <a href="https://www.picturehouses.com/">Picture Houses</a> site update (in it&#39;s current 2015 state).</li>
<li>Worked with the amazing team at <a href="http://www.ehealthafrica.org/">eHealth Africa</a> working on a very small part of their projects and produced a <a href="https://github.com/eHealthAfrica/universal-exporter/">project</a> that heavily involved 100s of 1,000s streaming objects and promises - a fun and tricky challenge!</li>
<li>Finally working with <a href="https://twitter.com/guypod">Guy Podjarny</a> to help build Snyk (primarily developing the CLI tool) to help (currently) node.js developers with security.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side projects</h2><p>As always, I try to keep one toe in side projects to keep myself challenged. The main side project that I launched in 2015 was <a href="https://confwall.com">Confwall</a> (though developed in late 2014).</p>
<p>Amazingly (to me) Confwall pulls a profit for my business which is partly due to some of the lessons I learnt from JS Bin during 2014, and it&#39;s always amazing seeing it being used by the audience.</p>

</figure>

<p>Other side projects included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/remy/inliner">inliner</a>, a tool I originally wrote back in early 2011 that takes a URL and produces a single <em>inline</em> file including all the assets.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/remy/bind.js">bind.js</a> a small and simple two data binding library.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/remy/autocache">autocache</a> a memorisation library backed by persistent store (with support for redis, localStorage and mongo).</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve also been working on a short book (5 chapters, around 12,000 words) on the Command Line Interface for beginners (likely web developers and designers who have limited experience with the terminal). It&#39;s 4 chapters down and 1 to go, <em>hopefully</em> I&#39;ll have written most of that final chapter before this post goes live, so I can get on with the production side of things and get it online and ready to buy. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WLLxMr5MF3U3I8FWF9MmXTreBh4hDaORZZhhRVLB87Y/viewform">If you&#39;re interested the TOC and would like to know when it&#39;s available to buy, you can pop your email in this form</a>.</p>
<h2>ffconf 2015</h2><p>We (Julie and I) ran <a href="http://2015.ffconf.org/">ffconf again this year</a>, and again, it was a huge success (if the feedback of our delegates is anything go to by).</p>

<p>We had 8 absolutely amazing speakers. We started a full <a href="https://remysharp.com/2015/08/28/diversity-scholarships">diversity scholarship programme</a> which was also a huge success (some truly inspiring emails from applicants).</p>
<p>We also managed a 50/50 gender split in our speaker line up. As I said on the web site: &quot;this isn&#39;t something we should be proud of, because it should be the norm, but it is what we&#39;ve got and we&#39;d like to share that with you&quot;. We&#39;re also working hard to improve the diversity of our audience and as always, more can, <em>and will be</em> done.</p>
<h2>Speaking</h2><p>I&#39;ve been actively turning down a lot of speaking for two firm reasons: firstly I wanted to be closer to family and not be travelling so much whilst the kids are still so young. Secondly, honestly, I didn&#39;t feel like I had anything to say - probably linked to self-worth, but that&#39;s for another day.</p>
<p>However, I was asked by JSCamp Romania to step in last minute for a speaker that couldn&#39;t make it and I suggest a JS Bin talk from 2014 called The Bits Behind JS Bin. A generally positive talk which always ended in a dark (and slightly bitter) note. It would end with this slide, and then I asked twitter if people wanted to hear more:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I realise it&#39;s a Sunday, but is there any interest in a talk about jsbin and this? It ain&#39;t a happy talk. +1/-1? <a href="http://t.co/Hjp0aM3CsO">pic.twitter.com/Hjp0aM3CsO</a></p>&mdash; rem (@rem) <a href="https://twitter.com/rem/status/605036102488072192">May 31, 2015</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On the fight to Romania, I started writing the content for a deck that would become &quot;The toxic side of free&quot;, then I went on to give the talk 7 times this year, including at jsconf.us (my 5th talk at a jsconf) - which was a huge privilege to be part of.</p>
<p>I also (finally) gave a talk at Fronteers (amazingly this was my 6th time to be asked, and I&#39;d always had conflicting plans). It was pretty frightening since I&#39;d had <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/">Jake Archibald</a> and <a href="https://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a> both independently warned that the Fronteers audience are particularly savvy and have high expectations of their speakers.</p>

<p>My talk was entitled &quot;The art of debugging&quot; (<a href="https://vimeo.com/145242226">video</a>). I wasn&#39;t lynched, which is always a good sign. The talk went over fine, I think. In addition though, I&#39;ve changed my method of preparing talks over the last few years. Instead of postit notes and scattered thoughts, I tend to write my talk as if it were a blog post and use that as the template for the slides. Of course, this means I can publish the post too, and from this, I&#39;ve had a lot of positive feedback (which is nice). Which segues nicely on to my blog...</p>
<h2>The b:log</h2><p>Last year I rewrote all the backend of my blog to be driven by static markdown files, and this revitalised my blog (in my eyes). Particularly seeing the <a href="/archive">archive</a>, I gave myself the aim to get <em>at least</em> two posts published each month.</p>
<p>So far I&#39;ve (nearly) managed that (one month has one post, whilst others have more than two), but that combined with keeping fully completed posts in draft state, and I&#39;m hoping to continue the momentum into 2016.</p>
<p>I prefer to write short and to the point blog posts, but traffic and page views show me that actually my super <em>long</em> form writing is the most successful (in the region of 2-6,000 words!). My most popular posts this year were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-1">The toxic side of free. Or: how I lost the love for my side project</a></li>
<li><a href="/the-art-of-debugging">The art of debugging</a></li>
<li><a href="/i-am-a-web-developer">I am a web developer</a></li>
<li><a href="/dont-like-open-source">&quot;Why I don&#39;t like open source&quot; – my thoughts</a></li>
<li><a href="/bind">bind.js: Tiny two way data binding</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2><p>I had a few personal goals and wins this year. My focus beyond family and work is my own personal health and strength. I finally hit the 18-year-old me waist size again (from 38 inches over 3 years ago) to 30 inches. In the gym I came <em>close</em> to 100KG bench press (though actually only hit 90KG x 8 back in April, and managed 100KG in a seated press). I only weigh 75KG so I&#39;m figuring this isn&#39;t too shabby.</p>
<p>I made a small tear in my back in late 2014 which stopped me from doing deadlifts and squats (which I really enjoy) and sadly it&#39;s still giving me jip a year later. I&#39;ve also continued to experiment and track my diet and it kind of pisses me off that it&#39;s taken me 2 decades to understand food to the level I do now (i.e. &quot;fat free&quot; is utter rubbish as a selling point - fats are <em>good</em>).</p><p><a href="/2015/12/31/my-2015">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p></section></article><article class="post lists"><header class="post-header"><h2 class="title">Recently Updated</h2></header><div class="post-content"><ul><li><a href="/2015/12/31/my-2015">My 2015</a><small>&nbsp; updated 30-Dec 2015</small></li><li><a href="/2015/12/18/promise-waterfall">Promise waterfall</a><small>&nbsp; updated 18-Dec 2015</small></li><li><a href="/2010/11/29/our-christmas-films-list">Our Christmas Films List</a><small>&nbsp; updated 14-Dec 2015</small></li></ul></div></article><article class="post lists"><header class="post-header"><h2 class="title">Remy Elsewhere</h2></header><div class="post-content"><ul class="links"><li><a href="http://leftlogic.com" rel="me" title="my business: hire me">Left Logic</a>&nbsp;- my business: hire me</li><li><a href="http://github.com/remy/" rel="me" title="Fork me!">Github</a>&nbsp;- Fork me!</li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/rem" rel="me" title="tweet, tweet">@rem &gt; follow me on Twitter</a>&nbsp;- tweet, tweet</li><li><a href="http://pinboard.in/u:rem" rel="me" title="link goodness">Bookmarks</a>&nbsp;- link goodness</li><li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/remysharp" rel="me" title="some for fun, some for geek">Flickr</a>&nbsp;- some for fun, some for geek</li><li><a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com" rel="me" title="tutorials &amp;amp; screencasts">jQuery for Designers</a>&nbsp;- tutorials &amp; screencasts</li><li><a href="http://www.ihatemusic.com" rel="me" title="old skool palm apps">Palm Apps</a>&nbsp;- old skool palm apps</li><li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/people/rem/" rel="me" title="my conf talks">Talks on Lanyrd</a>&nbsp;- my conf talks</li></ul><ul class="flickr"></ul></div></article></main><footer class="site-footer clearfix flex subpanel"><div class="flex-item archives"><h2>Archives</h2><ul><li><a href="/archive">All years</a></li><li><a href="/2015">2015</a></li><li><a href="/2014">2014</a></li><li><a href="/2013">2013</a></li><li><a href="/2012">2012</a></li><li><a href="/2011">2011</a></li><li><a href="/2010">2010</a></li><li><a href="/2009">2009</a></li><li><a href="/2008">2008</a></li><li><a href="/2007">2007</a></li><li><a href="/2006">2006</a></li></ul></div><div class="flex-item links"><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a href="/about">About Remy</a></li><li><a href="/ethos">Ethos (WIP)</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="/feed.xml">RSS feed</a></li><li><a href="/search">Search</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/remy">On GitHub</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rem">On Twitter</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/rem/past/speaking/">Presentations</a></li><li><a href="/house-rules">House Rules</a></li></ul></div><div class="flex-item license"><h2>License</h2><p class="vcard">All content by <a class="url fn" href="https://remysharp.com">Remy Sharp</a> and under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">creative commons</a> and code under <a href="http://rem.mit-license.org">MIT&nbsp;license</a>.</p><p>All code and content for this blog is available as <a href="https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com">open source on GitHub</a>.</p>
