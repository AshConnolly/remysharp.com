<p>Codecasting is the process of recording your coding session, and casting it out to any number of participants, generally in real-time.</p>
<p>JS Bin supports codecasting out of the box, for free, to both registered and anonymous users. Just share your bin&#39;s url with <code>/watch</code> instead of <code>/edit</code>.</p>

<h2>My backstory with codecasting</h2>
<p>September 28th 2008 is when <a href="http://remysharp.com/2008/10/06/js-bin-for-collaborative-javascript-debugging/">jsbin was put live for the first time</a>. There&#39;s somewhat of a backstory as to why I created it, and there&#39;s even a precursor site I built. That&#39;s since faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>It was December 2008 I went to visit <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> &amp; <a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy</a> at the <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> offices to ask their advice about the first workshop I would run (Iceweb 2008 in Reykjavik, Iceland). I sat down and told them my fantasy would be to use jsbin (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/4284906136/">the 2008 version</a>) and anything I typed on my presenter machine, the student could follow along and see the code, and could switch back and forth from the output to the code on their own machine.</p>
<p>I referred to this as Codecasting*.</p>
<p><small>* It was a term that had come naturally to me, and I&#39;m pretty sure I found an entry in Wikipedia way back and felt disappointed I hadn&#39;t invented the term, but now (2013) I look for the wiki page and I can&#39;t find anything. I digress.</small></p>
<p>The problem was streaming and persistent connections were hard (for me) with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP</a> stack.</p>
<p>In fact, I did get a <a href="https://github.com/remy/jsbin/tree/e895c32089ac1bd310b5d91aecabda219f2eccea">version working using cometd and the bayeux protocol</a>, and recall testing it with John Resig (partly because jsbin&#39;s simplicity was inspired by his <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/">Learning Advanced JavaScript site</a>).  It did just about work, but I knew it couldn&#39;t handle a lot of users because Apache would eventually bail.</p>
<p>So I left it.</p>
<p>...until I saw Ryan Dahl present Node.js at jsconf.eu nearly a year later in 2009. Codecasting suddenly was a) easy, and b) JavaSript based.</p>
<h2>Hacking codecasting in to jsbin</h2>
<p>A year later, I built (a still unfinished) <a href="http://forbind.net/">Förbind</a> - as &quot;Sockets as a Service&quot; site. This would be the ground work for adding codecasting to jsbin. In fact, there&#39;s still a link on the homepage to the <a href="http://jsbin.com/edifi3/1/edit">bin</a> that you could enable codecasting with (note that this doesn&#39;t work anymore - because codecasting is now native to jsbin).</p>
<p>In the few days that I built Förbind (a swedish word for join, or as I liked to think: connect), the codecasting was surprisingly stable.</p>
<p>But then my life around that time was hard, and jsbin (version 2) was <a href="https://github.com/remy/jsbin/tree/v2.9.16">still written in PHP</a> and I wanted native support for codecasting. So began the big rewrite of jsbin in the start of 2012.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a video of the first implementation of codecasting in JS Bin back in late 2010. Note that codecasting wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t limited to a single browser or single machine, JS Bin&#39;s version could run on multiple machines at once and all different types of browsers (though the Förbind version relied on Socket.IO, the current version doesn&#39;t and it relies entirely on EventSource and polyfilled techniques).</p>

<h2>Native codecasting in jsbin</h2>
<p>As of version 3 of jsbin, released in June 2012, codecasting is possible out of the box.</p>
<p>Take any bin you&#39;ve created, and instead of /edit in the url, change it to /watch, and any number of participants can watch you live code, and the output will automatically update as they watch.</p>
<p>If you (the owner of the bin) creates a new revision, this update will automatically propagate to the participants and they&#39;ll continue to be able to watch your work.</p>
<p>If the participant wants to create their own copy, they can just create a clone, and now they have a copy from that point in time.</p>
<p><small>This is also referred to as &quot;Professor Mode&quot; for pro users of CodePen (I believe). Codecasting in jsbin will remain free, even after pro users are added.</small></p>
<h2>How it works in jsbin</h2>
<p>Since v3 of jsbin saves pretty much every keystroke, when a save occurs on the server side, it triggers a &quot;ping&quot; event. This is listened to by the <code>EventSource</code> code. The code looks up the bin&#39;s url, and if anyone is listening, it pushes down the new code for that particular panel.</p>
<p>Both the full output views and the codecasting views listening to this EventSource endpoint, and since EventSource can be polyfilled, it works like a charm on all platforms. Simple.</p>
<p>In the future (of JS Bin) codecasts will be recordable and let you play them back (at a later date) and allowing you to add audio, video, annotations and anything else you want to create tutorials and examples of your work.</p>
