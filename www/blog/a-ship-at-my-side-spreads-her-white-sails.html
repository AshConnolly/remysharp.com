<p>I&#39;ve put this on my blog so I can always find it in the future. A friend sent this quote shortly after <a href="https://remysharp.com/search?q=tia">Tia</a> was born, and had died during delivery.</p>
<p>It struck me extrmely deeply. Mostly, I think, because our daughter had been born, and our lives had not changed one bit. We couldn&#39;t bring her home with us, there were no celebrations, no baby clothes. Everything was supposed to change, and yet we had nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>This quote gave me something to hold on to. The idea that just because I couldn&#39;t see my baby anymore, it didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t hadn&#39;t existed. I had watched her at leangth until we had to leave.</p>
<p>Tia was gone from my sight. She is just as loved as she was when she was in our arms. Her diminished size is in me, not in her.</p><p class="follow">Posted 2-Sep 2015 under personal. <span class="note">Find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/rem">here</a> I'll tweet about JavaScript, HTML5 and other such gems (amongst usual tweet-splurges)</span></p></div><div class="comments"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_shortname = 'remysharp';
