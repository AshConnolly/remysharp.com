<p>Notes/live blog from <a href="http://browser.londonwebstandards.org/">The State of the Browser</a> - unedited!</p>
<h2>Web vs. Native - <a href="http://twitter.com/mahemoff">@mahemoff</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Will apps kill websites&quot; - this month</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook 2011 backing HTML5, whilst investing in native apps -
instagram</li>
<li>Instagram has no website (yet uses the web)</li>
<li>Platforms, apps or otherwise, still using web infrastructure - via
RESTful services</li>
<li>Web - dev experience - boils down to view source + browser =&gt; already
going</li>
<li>UI capabilities still suck on the web - doing it consistently, with
smooth effects is HARDDDD</li>
<li>Offline doesn&#39;t matter so much?</li>
<li>Dev experience can be tricky for developers - maybe not the smoothest
or more compatible tech. ie. the localStorage &quot;issue&quot;.</li>
<li>Device integration is lacking - but will specs like WebRT solve this?
Will Google resist these kinds of specs - why aren&#39;t they leading this
or is there a politic play whereby Chrome Book doesn&#39;t require &quot;apps&quot;?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Were WebApps are lacking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single sign is hard</li>
<li>Intention</li>
<li>Device access</li>
<li>Background processing...native apps are able to proactively schedule
task in the background - web doesn&#39;t have this at all yet
(WebRT/thing?). Notifications / geo-fencing(?) / syncing. Background
seems like one of the worst/highest level of requirements we need to
compete web vs. native</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Challenge - what we need to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Advisory, like html5ple.se and some guidance - it&#39;s kinda like the 90s
again where there was a fuck load of JS libraries. Native has one way
on the web, we have many ways and polyfills to get around issues.</li>
<li>Web Apps should have support from the browser for single sign on - is
this WebID (was BrowserID), etc?</li>
<li>Developers need to contribute to &quot;moving the web forward&quot; - speak to
the browser vendors. But isn&#39;t part of the problem &quot;Fucking Apple&quot;,
they don&#39;t talk to anyone - nor do they release at any reasonable rate
so developers</li>
<li>Think about how web vs. native - web should remember your log in,
application state - it shouldn&#39;t appear to boot from scratch each
time, but this is where we should be using localStorage, and back
doesn&#39;t destroy state!!! Ajax + history api.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is the point: browsers don&#39;t matter - the web does...?</li>
<li>Should the browser just be the <code>webview</code>?</li>
<li>&quot;You&#39;re not on a fucking plane&quot; - but then do all devs know how to
build apps like gmail where it&#39;s insanely quick because they know how
to work the mobile device?</li>
<li>AppCache is not a replicatement for localStorage - far from it.</li>
<li>Is there a larger problem that the browser (and a pro) exposes data if
the user wants to get to it. It makes SSO harder because of security,
etc?</li>
<li>Web vs. Native seems like two issues: browser and the web. Browsers
being the limitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>No app is an island - <a href="http://twitter.com/paul_kinlan">@paul_kinlan</a></h2>
<p>Overview of some technology in browsers - &quot;we&#39;re moving faster than ever
before&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS regions - makes print designers super happy - in that the reflow
is correct.</li>
<li>CSS filters - take that Instagram - using same technology as WebGL
under the hood?</li>
<li>Web Components - shadow DOM is the &quot;component code&quot;. Web Components do
look really interesting because we&#39;ve been re-writing components all
the flipping time, but it seems to boil down to </li>
<li>WebRTC - gives us the stream (though gUM is part of it), allows us to
use a <em>stream</em> of video data (though god knows what format it&#39;s in if
we wanted to capture it...).</li>
<li>And a fuck load more APIs: Gamepad API, battery, pointer lock, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the point: &quot;tunnels and bridges&quot;...All tunnel creation is bespoke
(IRL), in that working across the web with things like oAuth is hard,
and could well go horribly wrong.</p>
<p>Bridges are different: common patterns are part of the process.</p>
<p>Future of web app dev - is &quot;client to client&quot; - &quot;bridging&quot;.</p>
<h3>Intents</h3>
<ul>
<li>No oAuth - because you&#39;re handing over?</li>
<li>Integrating the &quot;top 5&quot; APIs is hard, because a) they&#39;re all fucking
different, and b) what about when they shutdown (delicious), c) what
about when you don&#39;t integrate the <em>users&#39; favourite service</em>?</li>
<li>Intents offers your list of services for the intent, user selects the
service, and the service then returns the content in an open way -
without the developer having to support all these services.</li>
<li>Intent lets me send and receive =&gt; communication.</li>
<li>Proposing an <code>&lt;intent&gt;</code> tag</li>
<li>The content-type on the params determine the response kind, example: <code>var params = { type: &#39;video/mp4&#39;, data: blob, transfer: [blob] };</code></li>
<li>You can also establish communication channels (like P2P?) using
<code>Channel</code> API and using ports.</li>
<li>Can play today, Paul has written a polyfill with decent x-browser
support (IE8 upwards).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>What about defaults? Chicken and egg - the user is new, do you offer
default services? Is this even a problem?</li>
<li>How do services register their action handlers?</li>
<li>Really not keen on the <code>action=&quot;http://webintents.org/share&quot;</code> - why
the dependency?</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t the <code>startActivity</code>/<code>postResponse</code> assume a persistent page or
new tab or even background services? // No - it appears as just a popup, whilst my current page remains open.</li>
<li>Are other browsers implementing Intents? Equally is Google starting to
introduce it in their own apps, Google Drive for instance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The web as it should be - <a href="http://twitter.com/thebeebs">@thebeebs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Text Shadows weren&#39;t fast enough for IE9 - the GPU was used for fonts,
but the shadows were poorly performing (and equally on canvas - super
poor performance even though it&#39;s all hw accel).</li>
<li>First half of talk: IE sucks - yep - MS know it. IE9 is supposed to be
the new flagship. Honestly, still lacking, but IE10 is a good second
step.</li>
<li>8 week launch cycles with previews. 12 weeks with IE10.</li>
<li>Now collaborating (not more, but for a change).</li>
<li>IE10 moving to &quot;smallest chrome&quot; - what about &quot;Chromeless&quot;?</li>
<li>Ironically IE10 is touch, yet IE9 isn&#39;t!!!</li>
<li>Working on and contributing the CSS grid specification - combination
of row/column. Are other browsers picking this up?</li>
<li>IE10 is the delivery platform - within the browser and via the Metro
application platform.</li>
<li>IE10 appcache, data storage, etc. Basically where it should be.</li>
<li><a href="http://thebeebs.co.uk/prepare"><a href="http://thebeebs.co.uk/prepare">http://thebeebs.co.uk/prepare</a></a> - compatibility indicator via a script
include on your site - for debugging - things like userAgent sniffing,
etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>When is IE10 going to be available on mobile?</li>
<li>Once beyond the beta cycles, and in production ready, what about
updates beyond that time? Do we have to wait another year?</li>
<li>Is win.js implementing the standards - like File IO - is that going to
use the standards, rather than the old school WSH type API - that&#39;s
utterly bespoke to Windows?  The advantage of PhoneGap is that it
relies on a standard, so ultimately, one day in the future, you can
pull PhoneGap out and it should work. Can I pull out win.js and move
to another platform?</li>
<li>Touch - is this the standards based touch events?</li>
<li>Debugging tools?</li>
<li>Is IE10 the high street brand to the fashion industry? In that by the
time IE10 comes out, Opera, FF and Chrome will be 12 months ahead. I
guess this isn&#39;t a problem - if IE supports &quot;HTML5&quot; it means it&#39;s
serious business - I guess good for general web sites.</li>
<li>Seriously - why can&#39;t I install IE10 on my Mac directly? Or Linux?
Sure, Apple don&#39;t port Safari to Linux, and the Windows port is pretty
horrible, but they&#39;re arseholes anyway. // Response: No, they&#39;re
developing for their platform - to be fair - Apple to do the same.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Broken HTML5 promises - are we &#39;appy? - <a href="http://twitter.com/codepo8">@codepo8</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple is crippling the mobile browser. True, examples include WebGL,
storage, audio, etc, etc, etc.</li>
<li>Christian is asked at Mobile Congress is mostly around how do I protect
my code, how does it compare to HTML5 - UX &amp; performance.</li>
<li>HTML5 has to be a marketing term - so it won&#39;t ever be ready because
it encompasses a mass of technology ranging from true HTML5 to CSS to
Node.js!</li>
<li>Tooling is lacking. Dreamweaver type tools, but all the way to Final
Cut type tools - i.e. to compose amazing interactive sites. Current
offerings: <a href="http://html.adobe.com">html.adobe.com</a> and Sencha Architech...</li>
<li>Christian successfully takes the piss out of @thebeebs and @mahemoff,
who&#39;s next?</li>
<li>DRM is important to real companies. They have to protect their
content.</li>
<li>What about &quot;native&quot; performance? Zenga released a scroller library -
and discussion said it works better if it was written for iOS only.
Turned out that it was just the form value feedback that was slowing
it down. (canvas scroller).</li>
<li>Re: HTML5 is ready - did we pull it off? No, there&#39;s more questions
than answers right now. Those answers are hard (but isn&#39;t a lot of
this for the browsers to answer for us as developers?).</li>
<li>Christian says we&#39;re just keeping ourself busy with other things -
like demoscene or abstractions or random arguments like the
semi-colons (2nd reference - end on 3 pokes!). Why is Google and MS
releasing demos the canvas demos, etc. (Surely they&#39;re appealing to
developers to get them on board).</li>
<li>Talking about browsers stats. Me: honestly, these global stats don&#39;t
matter, the client user stats matter.</li>
<li>Patents: even when we can simulate or re-create the effects but
patents are killing innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>But &quot;enough with the bitching&quot;. Amen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla is a fully open organisation.</li>
<li>&quot;Kick ass&quot; devtools. I hope he&#39;s not referring to Firebug because I
really don&#39;t agree - the new devtools are a great step forward, but
still way behind.</li>
<li>MDN being supported not just by Mozilla - by people like Paul Irish
from <em>other</em> browser vendors. An excellent web resource for teaching.</li>
<li>More teaching from Mozilla and free access: mozparty, hack arcade,
hackasourus, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius-core">Gladius</a> - open source (on github) Mozilla supported game platform
(that won&#39;t be bought by another company and open!).</li>
<li>C++ to JS conversion with <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emscripten</a> (WTF!?)</li>
<li>Are we mobile yet - a visualisation of current state of mobile
support, with direct links to the bugs - so go shake a stick to get
them fixed.</li>
<li>Contributing lots of new specifications: battery, camera, vibration,
SMS sending - and all baked in to Boot 2 Gecko.</li>
<li>Christian demos a B2G which appears fast. My own copy is slow, but I
suspect the hardware is a huge factor.</li>
<li><a href="http://b2gbuilds.org">b2gbuilds.org</a> for getting nightly builds. Nexus S, Galaxy SII and
Galaxy Nexus flash image &quot;coming soon&quot;.</li>
<li>Lots of events being run in Mozilla&#39;s open space - also open for drop
in working.</li>
<li>Wants people to make things that work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why is UX coming up? Surely the OS should provide the UX for these
elements, buttons, etc. </li>
</ul>
