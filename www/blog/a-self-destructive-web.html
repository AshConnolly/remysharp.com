<p>I&#39;m finding myself more and more nowadays interested in content that <a href="https://twitter.com/rem/status/392601422480805888">self destructs</a>, or rather: expires after time and will no longer exist.</p>
<p>This post is more <em>me dropping my thoughts on a page</em> rather than having fully explored the idea (yet). Please note this post is also unedited (which I may use to my advantage and edit over time...we&#39;ll see).</p>

<h2>Saving is &quot;forever&quot;?</h2>
<p>From an early age I&#39;ve played and worked with computers. I always understood that I was creating programs that would be <strong>saved</strong>.</p>
<p>That simple idea of saving, be it to a physical tape (I was a Spectrum user) or fast forward to the 90s when I published my first web pages - it was simply naughts and ones and since it was stored digitally&dagger;, it could be copied over and over. When it was on a server, all it needed is the server to stay plugged in or even cached on another server and boom, you&#39;ve just unlocked <em>forever</em>.</p>
<p><small>&dagger; Sure, the tape drive wasn&#39;t digital, but you&#39;ll forgive me.</small></p>
<p>But the simple fact is: we have to make an effort to preserve. Server drives crash, data gets lost, companies disappear (my first site was on lineone.net if anyone remember that - now long gone), domains expire and people die.</p>
<p>So what is <em>forever</em>? Maybe there&#39;s an unspoken expiry? But when the expiry is in decades I feel like I conflate this with forever. I don&#39;t feel like the web community has been going long enough to see that long expiry showing it&#39;s face. Maybe we&#39;ve got another 20-30 years to go.</p>
<h2>Should it last forever?</h2>
<p>I <em>was</em> just looking at <a href="http://twitter.com/stef">Stef Lewandowski&#39;s</a> tweet about their new hack <a href="http://writing.makeshift.io/pieces/introducing-linkydink">Linkydin</a>. A nice idea, but I was asking myself: surely these links have context in <em>time</em>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re sharing a group of links in a team, should that information expire? What good is it a year (or more) later to new team members, and in fact could it share old and busted knowledge that&#39;s been superceeded by better information? <em>I don&#39;t know</em>.</p>
<p>Then I read <a href="http://twitter.com/neave">Paul Neave&#39;s</a> post <a href="http://blog.neave.com/post/64669185529/why-i-create-for-the-web">&quot;Why I create for the web&quot;</a> and he boils it down to the humble hyperlink. Except the way I <em>found</em> his post was through a tweet. A tweet that a) I will unlikely find again (because twitter&#39;s archive search is limited) and b) goes <em>through</em> twitter&#39;s own link shortening service. If that service is shut down, then that hyperlink is sent to the grave (note that this isn&#39;t the point of @neave&#39;s post - but it got me thinking).</p>
<p>I recently looked at Snapchat. Content that purposely destroys itself, I can only assume, because it&#39;s relevant for that moment &dagger;. I also remember someone having a blog that would slowly remove all the blog posts one at a time over a period of time (and it would look like the articles were fading out at the bottom of the site).</p>
<p><small>&dagger; Though Snapchat might <a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/50060403002/how-snaps-are-stored-and-deleted">not destroy the data on the phone</a> it is actually removed from their server, which, to me, means it&#39;ll expire from existence <em>somehow</em> eventually.</small></p>
<p>I like these later two because they&#39;ve thought specifically about time and how it should be addressed. My own blog, I haven&#39;t thought about time. I haven&#39;t thought about whether it&#39;ll shutdown after I die. I&#39;ve long stopped posting to <a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com/">jQuery for Designers</a> but I&#39;ll keep the domain renewed...but for how long? </p>
<p><strong>Should sites be retired to the archive.org?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. A lot of these questions are why I&#39;ve asked Jeremy Keith to <a href="http://2013.full-frontal.org/#time">speak at Full Frontal</a> whereby he chose the title &quot;Time&quot;. I expect he&#39;ll add a lot of clarity to some of my thoughts, but no doubt raise a good deal of new questions.</p>
<h2>Everything ends</h2>
<p>Everything has an expiry. Nothing lasts forever, but maybe my expectations need to adjust on the web. If something lasts a few years on the web that&#39;s a good thing. If I can get my data out of a web service, then that&#39;s a good thing too (because I&#39;m now responsible for my content, like photos which I care about).</p>
<p>I&#39;m just very interested in seeing more services taking advantage of expiry as a feature. Heck, we buy and own (small) pets because the expiry is a feature! Why don&#39;t we use this more on the web?</p>
