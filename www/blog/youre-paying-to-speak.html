<p>There are many, many new speakers coming to the web community with their stories and standing up on stage and sharing. I applaud them. It&#39;s a scary thing to stand on stage and share your ideas. And there are many, many hours of work that goes in to the presentations.</p>
<p>I&#39;m talking to people like me who speak for the love of sharing knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> If an event is not covering your expenses (travel &amp; hotel) then <strong>you are paying to speak at their event</strong>.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>What it costs you</h2>
<ol>
<li>Your time working on slides when you could be working on project work</li>
<li>Your flight or train or taxi costs</li>
<li>Your hotel cost</li>
<li>Your time on the day at the event</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, you might generate work during some awesome-high-fiving-network session. Really? Okay. Yes, you have a &quot;free ticket&quot;, but most new speakers I know have their head in their presentation until it&#39;s over.</p>
<p>So you&#39;re out of pocket. And for what?</p>
<h2>What costs them</h2>
<p>Well, nothing. In fact you&#39;re providing content. And you&#39;re doing more than that. You&#39;re filling up the speaker roster with fresh and new content that&#39;s likely never been seen before. You&#39;re also auditioning for them, if you&#39;re good, they&#39;ll want you back, and their audience will have seen that you&#39;re good and buy more tickets to their event.</p>
<p>I know Flash on the Beach/Reason used this last &quot;audition&quot; technique, but in a positive way (to be very, very clear: Reasons is good, they do it right). They called it the Lift Pitch. 5 minutes (or 2 minutes this year) to get your idea across. Audience votes on the best one, and that potential speakers is invited back the next year to speak, and they&#39;re paid like every other speaker.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s the video that they&#39;ll release, which is more content for them, branded and perpetuating their brand. That <em>you</em> gave them, at your own expense.</p>
<h2>A free ticket?</h2>
<p>It seems only the big events that do this kind of thing. And with big events, come big venues.</p>
<p>By comparison, Full Frontal has 278 seats. No more, no less. So free tickets aren&#39;t something I give away willingly (one of my policies is that all previous years speakers are given a free ticket to the following year). So it <em>costs</em> me, the organiser, to give away a free ticket.</p>
<p>Now compare to Future Of, they have anything from 800 person capacity (based on it being in The Brewery again). If they sell out in minutes (or even days) then a free ticket has a high value. But they don&#39;t. A free ticket is worth near to nothing (<a href="#comment-607594">please also take a minute to read Lou&#39;s reply—the conference producer for Future Insights</a>).</p>
<h2>Wouldn&#39;t they be out of pocket with so many speakers?</h2>
<p>That&#39;s what a budget is for - which comes from ticket sales and sponsorship agreements. <strong>It is part of their budget because without a speaker, they have no content to sell</strong>. The answer is no, they would not be out of pocket.</p>
<h2>What do I want?</h2>
<p>Dear event: treat your content providers with dignity. At the absolute least, pay their expenses. Indeed, <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2013/08/paying_speakers_is_better_for_everybody/">they should be paid too</a>.</p>
<h2>Which events are doing this?</h2>
<p>So here&#39;s where I want your help. I&#39;m happy to list these events, and if you know (for absolute sure) that there&#39;s an event making you pay to speak, then comment (anonymously if you want), post me a tweet or email me (remy at remysharp), and I&#39;ll add it to a list here.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re an organiser of one of these events or work for one of these companies, please get in touch if this is wrong or you&#39;ve fixed your mistake - I&#39;ll happily remove any event from this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Future Insights and the Future of Web Design (et al) don&#39;t cover most of their rising stars&#39; costs</li>
<li>SxSWi don&#39;t cover the vast majority of speakers and panelists</li>
<li>Webconf Riga</li>
<li>Drupal conf</li>
<li>The anonymous event that <a href="https://gist.github.com/csswizardry/d1bd31e3ada9f5f5a6a6">approached Harry Roberts</a></li>
<li>FITC</li>
<li>Fluent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> there are always the odd exceptions to these, as you&#39;ll read the comments below, but it&#39;s the default policy that I believe should be changed and part of the budget for profit and non-profit.</p>
<p><strong>Please also read the comments</strong> below fully as they include details of how some events have changed their policies over the years (like Velocity) and tells of personal experiences.</p>
