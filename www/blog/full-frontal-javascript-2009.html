<p>Last Friday I saw through the very first <a href="http://full-frontal.org">Full Frontal JavaScript conference</a>. An idea that was born back on a snowy day in February, with me complaining there was no conferences dedicated to JavaScript (anymore) and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/4124570521/in/set-72157622854415414/">my wife, Julie</a> telling simply replying with <em>let&#39;s do it</em> (it helps that by day she&#39;s an events organiser).</p>
<p>So over the next 10 months, Julie and I slowly plodded our way towards Friday 20th November where 248 (or so) developers and designers would come to our sunny city of Brighton for a day dedicated to JavaScript.</p>
<p>What started as a bit of complaining and wanted to scratch my own itch, ended up being an excellent day of talks and very, very well received first time conference.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Leading up to the idea</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a passion for me. My hair stands on end when I talk about what can be done in this little language many have learned to love. I fell in love with JavaScript over 10 years ago when I realised I just needed a browser and notepad to code with. No compilers, no downloading tools, no SDKs. Just notepad and my imagination.</p>
<p>True, back then, my imagination was limited compared to today, but it&#39;s something that has kept me excited over a good number of years.</p>
<p>So when I found out that the US were running <a href="http://jsconf.us">JS Conf</a>, I <em>knew</em> I had to see something here in the UK.</p>
<p>JS Conf US turned out to be a massive success (well played <a href="http://twitter.com/voodootikigod">Chris Williams</a>, et al) which only cemented my feeling that the JavaScript community was (finally) coming together and there was a need for these conferences.</p>
<p>Once I had been convinced by Julie it was something we could do, I went about hand picking my speakers, and then announcing the conference. This also meant that there were no sponsored slots available, something I had been asked about after we launched, but I felt it was important to me to keep the content on topic and free of any sales pitches.</p>
<p>I was also adamant that the cost of the ticket should be cheap enough that <em>I</em> would be happy to go along. Sometimes you don&#39;t know how much you&#39;ll get out of a conference, so when faced with a £500 ticket price it&#39;s tough to justify, especially if you&#39;re a freelancer. I felt that around the £100 mark made it a much easier decision to make, freelancers and full timers alike.</p>
<h2>Going from 90 to 250</h2>
<p>Originally Julie and I had looked at, and were about to book, a venue in Brighton in a hotel convention room.  It would hold about 80-90 people, was relatively posh, but still felt like it might come off as a meet up rather than a conference.  This wasn&#39;t a big deal, but I wanted the day to feel special for the delegates along with delivering awesome talks.</p>
<p>However, a little over a week before the conference was set for 90 people, I had a conversation with <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a> changed all that. It went pretty much like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremy: You should run Full Frontal at the Duke of Yorks cinema</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He waves two fingers across my face whilst doing so, in an Obi Wan-esque way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: you know what, I should run Full Frontal at the Dukes of Yorks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my best &quot;these aren&#39;t the droids we&#39;re looking for&quot; face.</p>
<p>And that was that.  We got on to the Duke of Yorks and suddenly our conference was increased by 150% - and the venue change was a superb suggestion, it added so much more character to the conference, and resulted in tweets such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At #fullfrontal09. Most comfy seats I&#39;ve ever [known] at a conference &mdash; <a href="http://twitter.com/jot/status/5885454457">@jot</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So thank you Jeremy :)</p>
<h2>JS Conf.eu</h2>
<p>Two weeks before Full Frontal, I had the honour of speaking at <a href="http://jsconf.eu">JS Conf.eu</a> - which was an amazing conference. In fact, I highly recommend it for anyone wanting more JavaScript than you can throw a bunny at.</p>
<p>It was so good, that it actually started to really worry me that my own conference wouldn&#39;t live up to my own expectations, let alone the delegates (seriously, JS Conf was awesome).</p>
<p>The guys behind JS Conf.eu, <a href="http://twitter.com/janl">Jan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cramforce">Matle</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/hblank">hblank</a> were all supportive of Full Frontal, and as I like to see in <em>normal business</em>, there was a collaboration of conferences rather than competition.  My hat goes off to you chaps (and everyone who supported your conference).</p>
<h2>The day</h2>
<p>The day was a HUGE success. A few issues I hit were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wifi was pretty nuked - but to be fair, that&#39;s the case at most conferences and I told all the delegates at the start of the day to use their 3G. My intention was that since most people would have mobile devices, they could tweet from there - and they did! :) I don&#39;t see this as big deal and I&#39;m happy with how it was handled.</li>
<li>I forgot music for the intervals, which only really showed in the morning when delegates were arriving, but by 9:10am I had hooked up my iPhone&#39;s music to the PA system, and the silence was broken. As it turns out, we didn&#39;t need it during the breaks.</li>
<li>Lunch was a bit of a mad rush for the speakers. In fact, since we (the speakers and supporting staff) didn&#39;t get over to the local pub until (what seemed like) everyone else had, we didn&#39;t manage to get served before the 2nd half of the day resumed, so it was sandwiches all round. Not a biggie either.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was about it for problems. Pros included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hugely comfy seats and venue with great character</li>
<li>Frickin&#39; awesome talks from <a href="http://twitter.com/codepo8">Christian</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/robertnyman">Robert</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ppk">PPK</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/sil">Stuart</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/toddkloots">Todd</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jaffathecake">Jake</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/simonw">Simon</a></li>
<li>Jake&#39;s talk was not only pure comedy throughout, but riddled with genuinely good content, a balance that&#39;s hard to strike</li>
<li>A successful after party (which I <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/11/16/going-full-frontal-in-one-week/">bought the first round</a> for everyone)</li>
<li>Everyone&#39;s really positive feedback to Julie and I after the conference and at the after party</li>
</ul>
<p>And few more nice thing <a href="http://snapbird.org/rem/favs/fullfrontal09">tucked away in twitter</a>, and lots of pictures have been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/fullfrontal09/">uploaded to flickr</a> too (under the #fullfrontal09 tag).</p>
<h2>Thank yous</h2>
<p>The conference was a success because of a number of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s sponsors: Yahoo! developer network, Guardian&#39;s open platform, Opera, .net, Dharmafly, O&#39;Reilly and AVT.</li>
<li>All of our delegates</li>
<li>Our volunteers: Claire, <a href="http://twitter.com/yandle">Danny</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales">Jon</a></li>
<li>Julie - my wife, who ran the strategic parts of the conference organising and the actual day itself, and kicked me up the bum to get Full Frontal to you all.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Full Frontal 2010?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. I&#39;ll be releasing dates and a site as soon as possible. A <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/123">Jeremy said</a>, I&#39;m going to have a hard job of matching this year&#39;s standard, but, hey, I&#39;m up for a challenge if it means more awesome JavaScript talks!</p>
