<p>I&#39;ve recently released a number of changes to JS Bin after I started to tinker (again) with Service Worker support in JS Bin (no, there&#39;s nothing there right now). However, since the release on Saturday, the CPU has been steadily sitting at 95% - which is dangerously close to the <a href="https://jsbin.com/test/error/502">502</a>-o-death page.</p>
<p>Except, if I&#39;m honest with myself, the CPU has been high since...well, since I can remember (going further back into 2013).</p>
<p>Until this afternoon. I made one change, and boom: 20%. Stable. Also, I&#39;ll be filling this under <a href="https://remysharp.com/search?q=%22duh%22">&quot;duh&quot;</a>.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Although JS Bin&#39;s code would load a config file and <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/blob/master/lib/app.js#L61">set the</a> <code>NODE_ENV</code> dynamically. Except...it wasn&#39;t actually being set early enough.</p>
<p>I changed the <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/production/blob/master/apps.jsbin.com/etc/init/jsbin.conf#L18">upstart script</a> to execute <em>directly</em> in production mode, and voilà, the CPU dropped to a nice stable 20% (or so, rising and falling as I&#39;d expect).</p>
<h2>The how</h2>
<p>The obvious thing was that the CPU was running very hot and consistently. JS Bin has a lot of traffic, but when the CPU is that high, it&#39;s usually going to die rather soon. As I had released some changes at the weekend, I knew that it was potentially a problem in the new code - the problem was also that JS Bin has run around the 70-90% mark for many, many months.</p>
<h3>Instrumentation</h3>
<p>The code would need instrumentation, so I looked at some tools to see if I could get some insights into what was going wrong. I <em>used</em> to have a (free) nodetime account but that wouldn&#39;t let me in because I had somehow run more than one application with the API key.</p>
<p>I tried out New Relic, which after first was pretty awesome, amazing charts, very pretty (though didn&#39;t lead me to anything obvious) - but something seemed wrong in the JS Bin process. The memory footprint was going up pretty steadily to capacity. Soon enough the process topped out and I removed the New Relic code. It turns out there&#39;s a <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/memory-leaking-only-with-node-js-agent-installed/14448/28?u=cjones">memory leak that&#39;s being addressed</a>, but it&#39;s not solved at the core (since it&#39;s a node problem rather than New Relic).</p>
<p>StrongLoop was next, but once I got the CLI tool installed (after some issues), I couldn&#39;t work out how to connect to the client using the web interface...at all. Another abandon.</p>
<p><a href="https://keymetrics.io/">Keymetrics</a> was also suggested (which, I believe, is produced by the makers of <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">PM2</a> a Process Management tool for node) - but it didn&#39;t look like it could do instrumentation, so I didn&#39;t proceed.</p>
<p>In the end though, and randomly, my nodetime account started working..!</p>
<p>The problem was: I&#39;ve never really been able to read the nodetime data to make head nor tail of it...</p>
<h3>Clues</h3>
<p>Heading straight for the transaction profiler, I started watching the operations. The transactions refer to routes being hit, as since there&#39;s so much varied traffic, it doesn&#39;t really give any clues as to what&#39;s slow (unless there&#39;s a specific bin causing the problem). But there it was, clear as day:</p>
<p><img src="/images/nodetime-transactions.png" alt="Nodetime transaction operations"></p>
<p>All that file IO shouldn&#39;t be happening. When looked closer, I could see the <code>readFile</code>s were all around my <code>view</code> directories. My templates. I had switched from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs">hbs</a> to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-hbs">express-hbs</a> but it seemed weird that it wouldn&#39;t use pre-compiled templates in production mode.</p>
<p>I did some digging, of course there&#39;s no mention of switching to compiled templates in production mode in either npm modules (pre-compiled templates would mean it wouldn&#39;t read from disc to constantly be serving files).</p>
<p>Realising this, I figured my process must think it was in a development mode, and immediately updated my upstart script to run JS Bin with <code>NODE_ENV=production</code>.</p>
<p>The result was going from this (note <code>run.js</code> CPU):</p>

<p>To this:</p>

<p>So, yeah. Filed under &quot;duh&quot;.</p>
