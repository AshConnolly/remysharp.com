Again. Phew.</p>
<p>However, as dug past the congratulations I found two things that upset me. I wanted to address them in this post.</p>

<h2>A precursor</h2><p>Nothing that I&#39;m about to outline is a breach of the <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">Code of Conduct</a> which we use for ffconf. What I mean to say is that ffconf is <em>my</em> event, and if I feel something is wrong, I want to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>I want ffconf to be a safe environment for all that attend.</strong> I will do this at the expense of blocking individuals from attending if I have good reason to do so.</p>
<p>This is me, using my position of privilege to make ffconf a safer environment for all.</p>
<h2>Recruiters</h2><p>I&#39;m not against companies looking to recruit. Indeed most companies in web tech are trying to recruit talent and that&#39;s perfectly fine. It&#39;s fine because those companies and individuals representing these companies are there to enjoy the event, learn and socialise afterwards.</p>
<p>However, recruiter <em>networking</em>, aggressively working the room at the after party is unpleasant for many. In fact, I&#39;ve heard directly from many attendees that said it was unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Like having a recruiter <em>pretending</em> to be a developer (or pretending to have some knowledge of your field), then glazing over when you <em>do</em> start to talk technical and glancing at their boss looking for a way out.</p>
<p>Or being told that you should move to London because that&#39;s where all the work is. Or being emailed with false claims about ffconf, and how the recruiter can <em>get you</em> some JavaScript developers.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why this is not okay: the first is that it&#39;s cold-call, <em>hard sell</em> approach to sales. It&#39;s uncomfortable and unpleasant for those being approached.</p>
<p>The second is <strong>most importantly</strong> the tickets taken up by these recruitment companies should have gone to people that would have genuinely benefited from the event. <strong>This</strong> is the reason that I will make changes for 2016&#39;s event to prevent recruiters from the event.</p>
<h2>&quot;It&#39;s okay, that&#39;s just men&quot;</h2><p>In particular, at ffconf I asked the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/lrnrd">Lena Reinhard</a> to give a talk about community, open source and diversity. Lena&#39;s talk was awe-inspiring. Extremely heavy content and extremely powerful messages.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/almostobsolete/status/662679575932092416">one attendee</a> put it: &quot;some difficult and uncomfortable truths&quot;.</p>
<p>There was (at least) one individual that was being loud and obnoxious during and after the talk. When I heard about this from a few of the women that attended our event, although they were offended, they passed it off with <em>that&#39;s just men, I&#39;ve seen worse</em>.</p>
<p>I understand why, but it&#39;s not okay with me. I want to create a safe space at ffconf, and I want attendees to know that it is <em>not</em> acceptable.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I know this will take time, and this will take years (since our event is once a year), but I will follow through on this, and I will create a safe and respectful space in ffconf.</strong></p>

<div class="update"><strong>Updated 2015-11-11:</strong> I&#39;ve updated the &quot;that&#39;s just men&quot; section to try to remove any implied message, or opinions that some readers thought I was trying to put across. Hopefully this is clearer now.
