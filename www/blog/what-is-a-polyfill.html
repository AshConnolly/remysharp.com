<p>A polyfill, or polyfiller, is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide <em>natively</em>. Flattening the API landscape if you will.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Where polyfill came from / on coining the term</h2>
<p>It was when I was writing <a href="http://introducinghtml5.com">Introducing HTML5</a> back in 2009. I was sat in a coffeeshop (as you do) thinking I wanted a word that meant &quot;replicate an API using JavaScript (or Flash or whatever) if the browser doesn&#39;t have it natively&quot;.</p>
<p>Shim, to me, meant a piece of code that you could add that would fix some functionality, but it would most often have it&#39;s own API. I wanted something you could drop in and it would silently work (remember the old shim.gif? that required you actually inserted the image to fix empty <code>td</code> cells - I wanted something that did that for me automatically).</p>
<p>I knew what I was after wasn&#39;t progressive enhancement because the baseline that I was working to required JavaScript and the latest technology. So that existing term didn&#39;t work for me.</p>
<p>I also knew that it wasn&#39;t graceful degradation, because without the native functionality and without JavaScript (assuming your polyfill uses JavaScript), it wouldn&#39;t work at all.</p>
<p>So I wanted a word that was simple to say, and could conjure up a vague idea of what this thing would do. <em>Polyfill</em> just kind of came to me, but it fitted my requirements. Poly meaning it could be solved using any number of techniques - it wasn&#39;t limited to just being done using JavaScript, and fill would fill the hole in the browser where the technology needed to be. It also didn&#39;t imply &quot;old browser&quot; (because we need to polyfill new browser too).</p>
<p>Also for me, the product Polyfilla (spackling in the US) is a paste that can be put in to walls to cover cracks and holes. I really liked that idea of visualising how we&#39;re fixing the browser. Once the wall is flat, you can paint as you please or wallpaper to your heart&#39;s content.</p>
<p>I had some feedback that the &quot;word should be changed&quot; but it&#39;s more that the community at the time needed a word, like we needed Ajax, HTML5, Web 2.0 - something to hang our ideas off. Regardless of whether the word is a perfect fit or not, it&#39;s proven it has legs and developers and designers understand the concepts.</p>
<p>I intentionally never really pushed the term out there, I just dropped it in a few key places (most notably the book), and I think it&#39;s when +Paul Irish  gave a presentation some (many?) months later, directly referencing the term polyfill, was when the term really got a large amount of exposure (I think this was also helped with the addition of the Modernizr HTML5 shims &amp; polyfill page).</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><a href="http://alexsexton.com/" title="AlexSexton.com">Alex Sexton</a> also <a href="http://twitter.com/SlexAxton/status/25600963629">classifies polyfilling as a form of Regressive Enhancement</a>. I think that sums it up nicely.</p>
<p><a href="http://paulirish.com">Paul</a> also <a href="http://paulirish.com/i/7570.png">defines it as</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shim that mimics a future API providing fallback functionality to older browsers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Examples</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s an example: <code>sessionStorage</code> is available in all the latest browsers (IE8 and upwards) but isn&#39;t in IE7 and below. </p>
<p>A polyfill can be used to <a href="http://gist.github.com/350433">plug the support</a> for older browsers that don&#39;t provide <code>sessionStorage</code>. </p>
<p>Now with the polyfiller in place, as a developer I can rely on using the Web Storage API (for sessions) and not have to feature test in my code or fork to handle different situations. </p>
<p>Another example is providing canvas support in IE. This is really where the <em>poly</em> part can be seen. If there&#39;s no native canvas, we can provide <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/delay/archive/2009/08/24/using-one-platform-to-build-another-html-5-s-canvas-tag-implemented-using-silverlight.aspx">canvas support using Silverlight</a>. If Silverlight isn&#39;t available, we can drop down to using VML using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/">excanvas</a> (note that excanvas actually does also include a Silverlight bridge which I&#39;d expect it would try first anyway). Using these two scripts provides the developers with (faily) solid canvas backup should it not be native in the browser. </p>
<h1>Where it&#39;s from and where it&#39;s going</h1>
<p>Earlier on this year I co-authored <a href="http://introducinghtml5.com">Introducing HTML5</a> with Bruce Lawson. During the R&amp;D time I was looking at shims and techniques to plug missing APIs but they weren&#39;t quite progressive enhancement. I wanted a single word that represented this idea that there was a &#39;thing&#39; that could plug browsers but wasn&#39;t progressive enhancement but wasn&#39;t graceful degradation either. </p>
<p>Polyfilling seemed to fit what I wanted to say (in my head!).</p>
<p>Ployfilla is a UK product known as Spackling Paste in the US. With that in mind: think of the browsers as a wall with cracks in it. These polyfills help smooth out the cracks and give us a nice smooth wall of browsers to work with. </p>
<p>I tentatively used the new term during my <a href="http://remysharp.com/talks/#2010_html5conf">HTML5 talk</a> for <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/online-conferences/html5/">ThinkVitamin</a> back in June, but I didn&#39;t want to push it for fear of trying too hard to push a new term out. However I did sneak it in to Introducing HTML5, which I can only assume lead to what happened recently. </p>
<p>Recently at <a href="http://jsconf.us/2010/">JS Conf</a>, <a href="http://paulirish.com/" title="Paul Irish">Paul Irish</a> released a <a href="http://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills">list of polyfills and shims</a> - an awesome resource list to save us developers the pain of older browsers. </p>
<p>It looks like polyfilling has some legs, so let&#39;s start using them, and dragging older (and even the newer) browsers up to our expectations.</p>
