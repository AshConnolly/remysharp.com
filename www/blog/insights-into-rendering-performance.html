<h2>Spotting the Margarine Effect</h2><p>Okay, <em>jank</em>. I was browsing the <a href="http://2013.ampersandconf.com/">Ampersand</a> 2013 conference site. It&#39;s a lovely site to look at, but I noticed in Chrome it judders, just a bit, but it judders, so I wanted to dig in and see if I could identify <em>what</em> was causing the issue, and if I could apply a fix.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, as with most solutions, speaking to someone with more perspective helps/solves the issue - in this case <a href="http://twitter.com/jaffathecake">Jake Archibald</a> came up with the goods, but I&#39;ll get on to that later.</p>
<h2>Identifying the issue</h2><p>The first thing I turned to was the timeline tool in devtools. I recorded the timeline, and I can see the frames are rendering around every 30ms, which gives me ~30fps which is why I could see some juddering. The sweet spot is being in sync with the monitor refresh rate, which is usually 60hz, which approximately translates to 60fps - so one frame per screen render is 1000ms / 60 = 16.666ms - but let&#39;s say we&#39;re always aiming for 16ms for a frame*.</p>
<p><small>* It&#39;s quite possible I&#39;m making this all up - but it sounds like it fits!</small></p>
<p>The timeline initially looked like the following when recording and scrolling - note there&#39;s just the paint, and nothing else <em>appearing</em> to go on:</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/without-gpu-compositing.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/without-gpu-compositing.png" alt="without gpu compositing"></a></p>
<p>To get a fuller picture, we need to enable &quot;GPU compositing on all pages&quot; in chrome://flags.</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/enable-gpu-compositing.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/enable-gpu-compositing.png" alt="enable gpu compositing"></a></p>
<p>Now the same timeline recording looks like the following - note that we now have the composite task, and when I hovered over I could see this was taking around 10ms, that with the paint and anything else is pushing us over the golden 16ms, so it&#39;s getting rendered in the next <em>tick</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/gpu-compositing.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/gpu-compositing.png" alt="gpu compositing"></a></p>
<p>I can also turn on the CPU activity on the &quot;ruler&quot; (not to be confused with the ruler on the elements panel, the &quot;ruler&quot; is the strip in the timeline that show the frame time) (enabled via devtools settings):</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/show-cpu-time-on-ruler.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/show-cpu-time-on-ruler.png" alt="show cpu time on ruler"></a></p>
<p>Which confirms the frame is too big.</p>
<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>
<h2>Seeing the cause</h2><p>From the composite I can see it&#39;s the full window being rendered (because I can see the dimensions of the draw). I can also visualise this on the web page (rather than looking at the timeline) by ticking the &#39;show paint rectangles&#39; in the rendering section of the devtools settings:</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/rendering-options.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/rendering-options.png" alt="rendering options"></a></p>
<p>Note that if you want lots of visual feedback, you want to make sure the GPU compositing is enabled (as I explained earlier).</p>
<p>Now when I scroll the page, those parts that are painting, are highlighted in red:</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/red-paints.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/red-paints.png" alt="red paints"></a></p>
<p>So the <em>whole</em> page is being re-drawn.</p>
<p>This actually comes down to the <code>background-attachment: fixed</code> on the background image. How do I know that? I watched Jake give a talk at Mobilism 2013 (video to be added soon), and in fact I asked him.</p>
<p>Though I could have narrowed it down eventually since devtools was telling me something the size of the entire page was causing the painting.</p>
<h2>The fix</h2><p>The fix is to move the problem to it&#39;s own composited layer. Again, thanks to Jake for this tip, he suggested putting the background image in it&#39;s own layer with <code>translateZ(0)</code> applied. So a new <code>div</code> was inserted with the following CSS:</p>
<pre><code>left: 0px;
right: 0px;
bottom: 0px;
top: 0px;
position: fixed;
background-image: url(/images/brighton-bkg.png);
-webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
pointer-events: none;
</code></pre><p>Now we want to check the change actually made a difference.</p>
<h2>Confirming the change</h2><p>The first thing I did was to return to the timeline tool and record. Indeed I could see the composite time had reduced down - from about ~10ms to ~2ms - which gives us more room in the 16ms frame. Except there&#39;s something else going on consuming the rest of the time and the frames were between 30-60fps.</p>
<p>So I know the change was an improvement, but was it entirely worth it? I&#39;m not 100% sure.</p>
<p>There is another tool I also discovered that&#39;s useful for changes: the &quot;show fps meter&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="http://remysharp.com/images/fps-meter.png"><img src="http://remysharp.com/images/fps-meter.png" alt="fps meter"></a></p>
<p>I used this before the change and after I noticed a <em>subtle</em> difference. It&#39;s in the histogram on the right (which took me a while to figure out).</p>
<p>The range from bottom to top is the distribution of fps (over how long I&#39;m not sure). If it&#39;s bottom heavy, then I know it generally has a slower fps - in this case it looked like approximately 20fps. After the change the distribution changed, and moved more to 60fps with some sitting on 30fps - but it was starkly different, rather than bulging at the bottom.</p>
