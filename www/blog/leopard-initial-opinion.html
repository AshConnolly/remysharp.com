<p>Among thousands and thousands of other Mac lovers out there, I too purchased my copy of Leopard for it to arrive on Friday.  The ride wasn&#39;t as smooth as I expected, and there were some roller coaster moments.  There&#39;s also a few small things that don&#39;t work as expected, and there&#39;s a few gems that are unexpected.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Before the install</h2>
<p>The whole process wasn&#39;t helped by the charade that preceded my receiving the software.  Around midday I was told it was out for delivery.  At 6:30pm, I called again to be told it had been put out for delivery at 9:30am and that it had arrived at the depot (i.e. where they delivery <em>from</em>) at 11:30am.  Hmm...time machine was really working!  Finally I was told it was still at the depot, and wouldn&#39;t be delivered until tomorrow.</p>
<p>7:30pm that evening, a lowly messenger arrives at the door handing me Leopard.  Random.</p>
<h2>Backup!</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t.  I&#39;m not sure why I didn&#39;t, I&#39;m usually very good at this stuff.  I threw caution to the wind.  When Leopard had installed (about 1 1/2 hours unattended install), I found my email and all my iCal events completely empty.</p>
<p>I was quite ready to lob the OS out of the window and desperately hunt down my Tiger CDs.</p>
<p>I knew searching Google would probably not work, since the software was so new, it wouldn&#39;t have indexed any results yet.  So I went hunting on apple.com and technorati (in the hope someone had blogged their problems).  No one else appeared to have problems!</p>
<p>However, Apple did have the article &quot;<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306537">iCal, Mac OS X 10.5: Empty &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Work&quot; calendars may appear after installing Leopard</a>&quot;.  Sorted.</p>
<p>Mail, for some reason it hadn&#39;t removed my plugins, as a Mail upgrade normally would.  I removed them, and it worked just fine.</p>
<h2>A Few Gritty Bits</h2>
<h3>Resolution Independence</h3>
<p>With all the initial chatter about resolution independence, it doesn&#39;t look like it was ever to be so.</p>
<h3>Stack alignment</h3>
<p>There&#39;s an odd effect when opening a stack and then moving over it.  I kind of expected the current stack to stay in focus in the Dock.  I&#39;ve included a quick vid of what I mean (I&#39;m being picky).</p>

   />

<h3>Mail&#39;s RSS reader</h3>
<p>This was one of the features I was looking forward to most - to be able to consolidate all these messages.  However, since Mail doesn&#39;t import <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML" title="OPML - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">OPML</a> I&#39;ve got a manual job of adding 65 RSS feeds...</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking around for a hack, and <em>when</em> I find it, I&#39;ll post it up here.</p>
<h3>Apache 2</h3>
<p>Although later copies of Tiger came with Apache 2, the version I had running on both my machines ran 1.3.  In the upgrade, they sneakily moved me over to Apache 2 - which broke my offline dev environment :-(</p>
<p>I&#39;ve since <a href="http://remysharp.com/2007/10/27/lamp-in-leopard-osx-105-php5-and-apache-22/">posted how to fix it</a>, and staying with Apache 2.</p>
<h3>QuickSilver - show application menu broken</h3>
<p>I use the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/03/12/tme-quicksilver-application-menus">current app -&gt; show menu hack</a> for Quicksilver - now not working.  I suspect it&#39;s perhaps to do with QuickSilver hooking the menu nib...or something...fingers crossed it gets fixed soon.</p>
<h2>A Couple of Gems</h2>
<h3>Coverflow &amp; preview icons</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t use coverflow too much in iTunes, in fact barely at all.  However, I find my self in Finder going back to coverflow and skimming through my documents finding what I&#39;m after that little bit faster - and it&#39;s kinda fun too.</p>
<p>Quickview is really smart and very fast considering it&#39;s opening up all kinds of types of docs.  </p>
<p>I think this is the most unexpected feature that I&#39;m using.</p>

<h3>Network mounting &amp; unmounting</h3>
<p>If you move around with your Mac, then you may know of the pain that is: forgetting to unmount.</p>
<p>When Tiger doesn&#39;t unmount a network drive, and you disconnect the network - everything hangs for about 5 minutes while the OS goes off to work out what the heck happened.  </p>
<p>Now in Leopard, so far as my tests have shown, forgetting to unmount doesn&#39;t render your machine busy.  It&#39;s cached a tree of where you&#39;ve been already.  You can&#39;t access the files while you&#39;re offline, but it doesn&#39;t groak if you disconnect the network, but remain mounted.</p>
<h3>Scrolling</h3>
<p>You can scroll windows that are not in focus.</p>
<h3>iCal&#39;s icon</h3>
<p>No longer stuck on 17th of July when it&#39;s closed!</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>Overall, I&#39;m still impressed.  There are a few UI things that I&#39;m not quite sure about, but the same was true when I moved from Panther to Tiger - it just takes a little time to get used to the changes.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be getting myself and external drive for Time Machine - turns out you can&#39;t use S3 as a Time Machine disk :-(</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to hear what other people think of Leopard too.</p>
