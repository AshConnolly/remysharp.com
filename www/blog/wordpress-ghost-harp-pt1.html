<p>I&#39;ve been running my &quot;b:log&quot; on WordPress since late <a href="/2006">2006</a>, but today I give you the node backed blog.</p>
<p>This is a two part blog post, the first covering why I moved, what I tried and a few of the high level issues I ran in to. Part two will cover some of the technical detail that goes in to running my blog on the new node platform.</p>
<p>These posts are not intended as walkthrough on how to do it yourself, but simply sharing my experience and bumps I ran into on the way, hoping to impart some useful knowledge along the way.</p>

<hr>
<p>Over the years I&#39;ve had all the injections of Viagra adverts and the like over and over and over. Whenever I want to change anything, I&#39;d tend to give up, and for a few years now, I&#39;ve really wanted the source of my blog posts available in (something like) github.</p>
<p>This post is about the move and how I run my blog now.</p>
<h2>My goals</h2>
<p>In a totally ideal world, I wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fast blogging platform (not particularly for publishing, but for serving)</li>
<li>Backed by JavaScript (Node specifically) - because it&#39;s the most familiar language to me</li>
<li>Edit links for posts to go to github allowing anyone to make a suggested edit</li>
<li>Archives and tag listings</li>
<li>URLs would be customisable (because I have old URLs that I want to support)</li>
<li>Could run on a free hosting platform like Heroku</li>
<li>As a bonus, I could hack and improve the system</li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR here&#39;s the full source of my blog as it is today, on github: <a href="github.com/remy/remysharp.com"><a href="https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/">https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/</a></a>.</p>
<h2>Ghost</h2>
<p>I knew that I wanted to move to a node backed platform. Ghost seemed like the best fit, and I&#39;ve had the pleasure of meeting and listening to John O&#39;Nolan and Hannah Wolfe speak about Ghost, and I complete buy into the philosophy.</p>
<p>Exporting WordPress posts (and pages) to Ghost was actually very simple (I used the developer version of Ghost locally).</p>
<p>The only bump in the road was the error messaging during the Ghost import was pretty vague. But checking the devtools console yielded the answer, a 324 from my server during the upload process. So I tweaked nginx to allow for larger files to be uploaded and bosh. Fixed.</p>
<p>The next trick was the comments - which Disqus seemed like the default that everyone moves to. Obviously nothing to do with Ghost, but this process was tricky. The best advice I can give if you&#39;re doing this and keep hitting failed imports is: validate the XML (w3c validator is just fine), and hand-fix the invalid XML.</p>
<h3>Why I didn&#39;t stick with Ghost</h3>
<p>For the record, I think Ghost is an excellent platform for most users, particularly if they&#39;re coming to blogging for the first time or wanting to shift away from WordPress.</p>
<p>However, being a developer I wanted to add a few custom tweaks, specifically I wanted an archive page, a handful of URL rewrite rules and a few of the Ghost ways of doing things weren&#39;t quite what I wanted.</p>
<p>One particular example is all my old WordPress posts had split markers in them which Ghost doesn&#39;t support. They do have support for creating excepts, but if you want HTML you can&#39;t (at time of writing) append a read more to the link.</p>
<p>I tried to contribute to the Ghost project, but I ended up going down a rabbit hole for what was effectively a tiny change (submitting a pull request to a Ghost dependency Downsize).</p>
<p>The (understandable) problem is that Hannah and the Ghost team are producing code that works in a great deal of environments and so a quick PR here and there are great, but I can understand why they&#39;re not merged in right away if at all: there&#39;s a much bigger picture to consider.</p>
<p>I thought about just forking Ghost and permanently running my own version, but there&#39;s a fairly big system to inherit when all I&#39;m doing is serving pages...which I had done with Harp.js before.</p>
<p>So I made the jump to Harp.</p>
<h3>Ghost to Harp</h3>
<p>Harp is a static site generator. I&#39;ve used it in the past for <a href="http://2014.full-frontal.org">our conference site</a> this year and for the <a href="http://jsbin.com/help">JS Bin help &amp; blog</a> so I was already familiar with it.</p>
<p>However, harp requires static markdown files, so I went about connecting to the Ghost database via sqlite3 and exporting each of these records out as a static HTML file, whilst building up the <code>_data.json</code> file required by harp to represent the metadata.</p>
<p>The code I used to convert is on github here: <a href="https://github.com/remy/ghost-harp">remy/ghost-harp</a>. <em>Disclaimer</em>: I wrote this for my own database and requirements, so this may not work for you out of the box.</p>
<p>The conversion process is pretty simple, read the sqlite database, write to files. So I ended up with a folder structure like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">.
├── harp.json
└── public
    ├── _data.json
    ├── about.md
    ├── blog
    │   ├── 2007-moments.md
    │   ├── 8-questions-after-ie-pissed-the-community-off.md
    │   ├── _data.json
    │   ├── _drafts
    │   │   ├── _data.json
    │   │   ├── my-velveteen-rabbit.md
    │   │   └── why-i-prefer-mobile-web-apps-to-native-apps.md
    │   ├── a-better-twitter-search.md
    │   ├── wordpress-tagging-and-textmate.md
    │   └── youre-paying-to-speak.md
    ├── talks.md
    └── twitter.md</code></pre>
<p>Some contents are going to be in HTML, but Ghost seemed to put my HTML posts in the markdown column (and since it&#39;s valid, it doesn&#39;t really matter).</p>
<p>One significant tweak I made was to put the post title <em>into</em> the post itself. For example, if you look at the source <a href="https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/blob/master/public/about.md">about</a> page, you&#39;ll see the title in the markdown. Ghost separates out the title and the body when you&#39;re editing, but I wanted a single markdown file.</p>
<p>The next task was to fire up harp and have it running from my newly generated <code>public</code> directory.</p>
<h2>Harp</h2>
<p>Now that all my content is in the <code>public/blog</code> directory (via my little rewrite script) harp could serve my content. Using a simple (empty) <code>harp.json</code> as the config, harp automatically knows to serve anything under <code>public</code> as the root of the site (i.e. <code>/blog/foo</code> will serve the file <code>/public/blog/foo.md</code>):</p>
<p>My specific requirements for using harp were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serves <em>static</em> content (so I&#39;d have to compile to static .html)</li>
<li>Serves in production <em>without</em> the <code>.html</code> extension visible</li>
<li>Support rewriting of URLs, so that I could maintain my original URL structure of <code>/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;/&lt;post&gt;</code> rather than pointing to <code>/blog/&lt;post&gt;</code></li>
<li>I <em>really</em> wanted an archive, since I was simplifying a lot of my blog design, and losing a <em>lot</em> of navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I had to create my own custom <code>server.js</code> that would run a bespoke router (I did use an existing library, but I needed changes, so I forked my own copy).</p>
<p>Harp certainly made things harder than using Ghost, but I had the flexability I needed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m particularly proud of the <a href="/archive">archive</a> page, partly because I managed to write it entirely with Jade (which over the years I&#39;m slowly starting to warm to) and partly because I now have a page that lists <em>all</em> my posts since the first in 2006!</p>
<p>The version I&#39;m running today satisfies all the goals I outlined at the start of the project, and more.</p>
<p>A few bonus features I built are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can add <code>/edit</code> to any page to quickly jump to github to edit (along with edit links being on all the posts)</li>
<li>All the old demos and uploads from my WordPress site are hosted on Amazon S3 and redirected to via my <code>server.js</code></li>
<li>My development environment is slightly different to production, such as drafts are visible and the disqus comments are removed</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>one</em> thing I&#39;d like harp to be better at would be knowing what to regenerate. Due to this my release process involves rebuilding the entire blog site (~300 posts) and then pushing the changes to github and then heroku (where I&#39;m now hosting my blog) - though this is effectively an rsync, so it&#39;s not everything that goes up.</p>
<h2>The final product</h2>
<p>The final product and platform consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statically generated content in <code>/www</code></li>
<li>Source control in github</li>
<li>Production is hosted on a single dyno on Heroku</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/5bc02f2ef8976f">dnsimple</a> for <code>ALIAS</code> hosting to the heroku instance (so I can serve &quot;naked&quot; domains)</li>
<li>CloudFlare fronts the production blog</li>
<li>The major and minor version are used to cachebust the CSS &amp; JavaScript, due to this, it means changes to content are a patch release and all others are minor (or major) releases</li>
<li>The release process is a bash-like makefile that does all the compiling and revisioning for me</li>
</ul>
<p>So my whole release process for this blog post is now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ make release-patch publish</code></pre>
<p>And boom, just like that, you&#39;re reading the post!</p>
<p>In part 2, I&#39;ll explain some of the code that&#39;s used to drive my blog and some of the tricks I had to use to get harp to play exactly the way I wanted.</p>
