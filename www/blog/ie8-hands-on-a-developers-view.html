<p>Microsoft this week announced that they had <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx">reversed their decision</a> on the whole <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/theyshootbrowsers">backward rendering fiasco</a>, and today <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/DevelopersNew.htm">released details</a> of their plans for IE8.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft have earned themselves a hearty pat on the back, and perhaps even a nicely baked brownie and a cuppa tea.  Assuming they deliver on what they&#39;re promising.</p>
<p>The particular thing of interest to me was the integrated <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/DevelopersNew.htm">web development tools</a>, so I&#39;ve gone through it in some detail and reported here what I&#39;ve found.</p>
<!--more-->

<h2>Debugging Tools</h2>
<p>The biggest point of interest is the versioning combined with the development tools.  This seems to imply that since we can change the rendering engine in IE8 using a meta tag, then we should be able to use the same debugging tools against the IE7 rendered version of the page.</p>
<p>There is, however, a snag: if you look at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/DevelopersNew.htm#tools">versioning details</a> you&#39;ll see that it only supports rendering as IE8, IE7 and IE5...no IE6.  </p>
<p>IE6 is browser most in need of these development tools.  That&#39;s a real shame.</p>
<p>The debugger feels like a hybrid of the Visual Studio Wed Developer Edition and the old Windows Script Editor.  It&#39;s all built in to IE which is great - no booting up extra apps, and ultimately, being able to set breakpoints and stepping through is perfect for finding that deeply set bug.</p>
<p><img alt="IE 8 Debugger window" title="IE 8 Debugger window" src="http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ie-8-debugger-window.jpg" width="600" width="320" /></p>
<p>The CSS treeview is very cool and gives you a good idea where an element is deriving it&#39;s style from.  You can also see in real time the effect of disabling a particular style.</p>
<p>However, the debugger is missing some functionality the Developer Toolbar had.  In particular the ability to add styles to the DOM element.  Maybe I&#39;ve missed the functionality during my time playing with IE8 - someone please correct me if I&#39;m wrong - but it doesn&#39;t seem to allow me to edit styles on the fly.</p>
<h2>Does IE8 Overwrite IE7?</h2>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>However, it does let you emulate IE7 via toolbar button.  This is good.</p>
<p>However (again), if you&#39;re running a stand alone IE6, is <em>seems</em> to be okay, but the actual application itself might be a little broken.  For example, going to the about page for IE6 throws a JavaScript exception...odd.  This kind of behaviour makes me suspicious.</p>
<h2>JavaScript 1.6</h2>
<p>Sadly, it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s there.  I ran a few tests probing for <code>forEach</code> and <code>map</code> and <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.6">the like</a> but it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re in place.</p>
<p>There are also reports that Microsoft&#39;s <code>attachEvent</code> is here to stay, so we shouldn&#39;t go removing our currying just yet.</p>
<h2>CSS Support</h2>
<p>IE8 is supposed to cover all of CSS 2.1.  <a href="http://andrewdupont.net/">Andrew Dupont</a> has posted with a <a href="http://andrewdupont.net/2008/03/05/thought-internet-explorer-8/">CSS validator</a> that runs the query against IE8&#39;s <code>querySelector</code> function.</p>
<p>From my own testing, it looks like all of CSS 2.1 is in place, but Andrew has pointed out that <code>:first-child</code> isn&#39;t being supported.  I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve tested incorrectly, if it&#39;s a discrepancy in versions or what, but it&#39;s definitely worth giving it a test yourself to be sure.</p>
<h2>HTML Support</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t expect the HTML to be a problem, but looking at my blog in IE8, I can see a few small errors.  The first thing that stood out to me, is that it looks like the hasLayout bug is still in place.  However, using <code>zoom: 1;</code> didn&#39;t seem to shift it.  I&#39;m not an expert here, so I&#39;ll leave this one to colleagues, readers and the experts alike.</p>
<p>Also, where a <code>legend</code> element has always sat on the <code>fieldset</code> border - in IE8 it doesn&#39;t:</p>
<p><img src="http://remysharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/legend-in-ie8.jpg" alt="Legend in IE8"></p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Overall, I think IE8 is an exciting release.  John Resig also <a href="https://twitter.com/jeresig/statuses/767241778">points out</a> IE8 will have ARIA support, which, as he suggests, shifts the focus back on to the <em>other</em> browsers to raise the bar.</p>
<p>This release from Microsoft has sparked as much interest in me as when IE4 was being touted about and we first started being able to play with DHTML.  </p>
<p>I genuinely think that Microsoft have a chance of regaining respect in the development community again if they keep this up.  I am, however, not going to hold my breath for too long.  We still need to get IE6 under the carpet, and that&#39;s still years away - particularly in the UK corporate market.</p>
