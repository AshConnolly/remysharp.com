I wasn&#39;t quite sure whether it warranted it, as it&#39;s only a brief mention of the potential trigger, but it felt like that was <em>enough</em> to justify the warning.</p>
<p>Trigger warnings apply to a wide range of traumas, and I wanted to ask that if you, my dear reader, are giving talks at a conference, please consider whether your content requires a trigger warning.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong><em>Trigger warning: infant death.</em></strong></p>
<h2>My experience</h2><p>The obvious candidates for trigger warnings (or certainly to me in an earlier life) are any form of abuse.</p>
<p>I wanted to share the experience I had attending a conference in New York a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>The speaker had been introduced on stage to talk about how they got involved with start-ups and created business and generally talk about how they were awesome.</p>
<p>The talk was very focused around bootstrapping business when all of a sudden I found myself listening to the gentleman talking about a baby that was born, and suddenly he was running to hospital with it in his arms and the baby died.</p>
<hr>
<p>My baby had died.</p>
<p>Still to this day, I have no idea how or why he shoehorned this story into his talk. Obviously it was important to him. <em>Obviously</em>. But as an audience member, it hit me like a sack of bricks in the stomach.</p>
<p>All I could think about was my own daughter. I felt completely alone, and a very, very long way from home, my safe place.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea how he finished his talk. The rest of the event is a haze to me, and because of this isolated incident, it&#39;s trashed my memory of what should have been a decent event.</p>
<p>Had the speaker included just one statement up front that his talk contained infant death, then I could have chosen to leave, or I could brace myself for the content. Instead, I felt anger towards the speaker for hurting me in such a way. Using, to me, a story of terrible pain, as a highlight for his talk.</p>
<hr>
<p>So if you&#39;re giving talks, just think about whether you need a trigger warning. I&#39;ve been giving public talks now for 7 years, and I now have have a talk that includes a trigger warning. Just consider it, and pass this sentiment on to your peers.</p><p class="update">Drafts may be incomplete or entirely abandonded, so please forgive me.
