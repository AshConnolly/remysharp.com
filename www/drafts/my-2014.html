<p>As with previous years (barring 2008, oddly), I&#39;ve tried to wrap up the highlights of my year for future Remy&#39;s reading pleasure.</p>
<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>This year has been a mixed bag from a professional stand point, mostly revolving around JS Bin.</p>
<h2>JS Bin</h2>
<p><img src="https://remysharp.com/images/jsbin-t-shirt.jpg" alt="JS Bin"></p>
<p>Back in September 2013 I decide that I would try to focus my full time efforts on JS Bin, and after speaking to many individuals at conferences and events, I decided that the right path would be to add Pro accounts.</p>
<p>Take up has been...okay. Except it took 8 months to actually get to launch. A mistake. It should have taken 2-3 months, and I shouldn&#39;t have been so hell bent on getting it perfect. Putting 100% effort into a project with no capital and no income meant a pretty serious hit to my own business.</p>
<p>All in all, not a huge success, not really a medium success either. But over time it&#39;ll make some money and hopefully. There&#39;s also a couple of other business models I can explore, but my biggest problem is I&#39;m not a particularly good business person.</p>
<p>That all said, JS Bin is going no where. I&#39;ve run it as side project for over 6 years, and I&#39;ll continue to run it that way. There&#39;s production grade servers in place, something like 12 million bins in our database and lots of cool stuff still to be done. And the truth is, when it&#39;s fun to work on JS Bin, it&#39;s <em>fun</em>.</p>
<h2>Left Logic</h2>
<p>At the start of the year I took on a new office (actually the same size as what I had before, but I was the sole tenant this time) and I took on two new full time employees <a href="https://twitter.com/allouis_">Fabien O&#39;Carroll</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/electric_g">Giulia Alfonsi</a>, and also <a href="https://twitter.com/dcgauld">David Gauld</a> as a part time/freelancer.</p>
<p><img src="https://remysharp.com/images/leftlogic-team-2014.jpg" alt="Left Logic 2014 team"></p>
<p>But as the year went on, I couldn&#39;t (afford to) renew Giulia contract and Fabien was tempted away by local Brighton company, Brandwatch (I&#39;m proud to say after he turned them down a few times first).</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a huge pleasure working with Giulia and Fabien - they&#39;re both great people to know and damn good developers. David&#39;s led the <a href="http://leftlogic.com">Left Logic</a> redesign and is continuing to contribute to Confwall (a new product from Left Logic).</p>
<p>But as 2015 starts, there&#39;s no point in having an office <em>just</em> to myself, so I&#39;m selling all the kit, closing the office and returning to a roaming desk, for all the excitment and concern I have!</p>
<h2>Speaking &amp; Travelling</h2>
<p>Over the last few years I&#39;ve been reducing my public speaking further and further down. This year I only gave two differnt talks and only three events.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not terribly proud of the talks either, and I feel like they were either duff notes or bombed entirely. Obviously you have a different perspective on things from the stage, but it&#39;s definitely put me off speaking for a while.</p>
<p>I did do an epic write up of my <a href="/muddling-my-way-through-real-time">real-time talk on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>On the flip side though, I did spend more time attending events just to learn. Oddly, I had quite a few people exclaim &quot;are you speaking?!&quot;. That&#39;s cute, but there&#39;s certain perks to not speaking: like <em>not speaking</em>!</p>
<p>Particular highlights for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://2014.dareconf.com/mini/london">Dareconf mini</a> (London, UK)</li>
<li><a href="https://edgeconf.com/2014-london">Edge London</a> (London, UK)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hybridconf.net/">Hybrid Conf</a> (Stockholm, Sweden)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smartwebconf.com/">SmartWeb</a> (Bucharest, Romania - where I also spoke)</li>
<li><a href="http://2014.jsconf.eu/">JSConf EU</a> (Berlin, German - more for the people &amp; conversations)</li>
</ul>
<h2>ffconf</h2>
<p>This year, our little event sold in two batches, going in 6 and 3 minutes. Insane.</p>
<p>I was nervous about this year because I had lot a speaker that I really want to hear and I was struggling to find the right balance of what I wanted. There&#39;s also the simple problem that each year has been better than the last, so eventually it has to do worse.</p>
<p>I was wrong to be nervous.</p>
<figure><img class="withcredit" src="https://remysharp.com/images/ffconf-2014.jpg" title="Photo by Drew McLellan"><figcaption class="credit">Photo by Drew McLellan</figcaption></figure>

<p>The event was amazing (from me as an attendee point of view) and the <a href="http://www.outsidethepage.co.uk/full-frontal-2014/">feedback</a> was <a href="http://www.uvd.co.uk/blog/full-frontal-2014-highlights/">equally</a> <a href="http://kyan.com/blog/2014/11/11/full-frontal-2014">positive</a>.</p>
<p>See for yourself - all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTqrwW2jjXIXuCtFQ-5BIn-s">eight talks from ffconf are available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Although there&#39;s not as many side projects as I&#39;d like this year, it&#39;s clear to me that JS Bin has been consuming my focus for the large part of the year, and that&#39;s <em>okay</em>!.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://confwall.com">Confwall</a> - a productised version of the twitter wall I&#39;ve run at ffconf for the last 6 years. Currently open to early beta registrations.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/53ff41ed8cdf37902b000050">Rest pebble app</a> - a native C app for the Pebble watch that lets me quick set rest timers at the gym.</li>
<li>Blog moved from WordPress (to a Harp/custom node app) and resumed blogging again - something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time, and I blogged about the process and also all on <a href="https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com">github</a>: <a href="/harp-pt1">part1</a>, <a href="/harp-pt2">part2</a>. I&#39;m most proud of the <a href="/archive/">archive</a> page.</li>
<li>nodemon 1.0 - then pretty much abondonning it for a 11 months and revisiting to add some sweet functionality (look out for 1.3.x in the new year)</li>
<li>Introducing HTML5 - this is <em>still</em> in the works to be published for free. Watch this space!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>In ascending order:</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Rewiring my blog has encouraged me to blogging again. I&#39;ve long fallen out of love with Twitter and return to blogging. I said before, but the <a href="/archive/">archive</a> of my blog has really encouraged me to carry on. I&#39;m pretty proud of the content.</p>
<p>This year I was also invited to the Pastry Box project, where I started posting some very personal thoughts, and I&#39;m proud to be <a href="/tag/personal">hosting them here too</a>. The three particularly important ones being <a href="/time-doesnt-heal">Time doesn&#39;t heal</a>, <a href="/velveteen">My Velveteen Rabbit</a> and <a href="/motivation">Motivation</a></p>
<h3>Me</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll spare you the pictures this time (though if you want to brave it, <a href="/my-2013#personal">here&#39;s last year</a>)! <strong>Last year I ended my body fat on 19% (down from 30%).</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Fitbit Aria scale, but over the months have lost confidence in their accuracy, so bought a pair of cheap, but more reliable skin calipers.</p>
<p>My body fat at the end of December 2014 (and over the month of December) is <strong>currently 13.8%</strong> (the scales are reading around 10%, which I don&#39;t trust). I also fit into 30 inch jeans and tops that I wore at aged 21 are baggy around my belly (yes, I have a few tops that are over 15 years old!).</p>
<p>My lowest weight (not that I want to be light) was 11 stone. I can see a 6 pack forming (which I&#39;ve <em>never</em> had in all my years).</p>
<p><strong>My biggest deadlift was 170kg</strong>, but I also tore a disc in my lower back trying to do a superset at 140kg (what had previously been a warm up weight). That cost me a month off the gym and 3 months self impossed ban on deadlifts and squats.</p>
<p>Diet is still heavy protien (and I found it quite easy to eat 1500kcals in a day whilst still having 7 meals a day), but I&#39;m trying to add weight at the moment and if I&#39;m honest, I&#39;m struggling!</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: 13.8% is in the <em>Athletes</em> range of body fat. So the future version of me, reading back, should be damn proud.</strong></p>
