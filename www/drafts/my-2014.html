<p>As with previous years (barring 2008, oddly), I&#39;ve tried to wrap up the highlights of my year for future Remy&#39;s reading pleasure.</p>
<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>This year has been a mixed bag from a professional stand point, mostly revolving around JS Bin.</p>
<h2>JS Bin</h2>
<p><img src="https://remysharp.com/images/jsbin-t-shirt.jpg" alt="JS Bin"></p>
<p>Back in <a href="/2013/08/14/jsbin-5th-birthday">August 2013</a> I decide that I would try to focus my full time efforts on JS Bin, and after speaking to many individuals at conferences and events, I decided that the right path would be to add Pro accounts.</p>
<p>Take up has been...okay. Except it took 8 months to actually get to launch. A mistake. It should have taken 2-3 months, and I shouldn&#39;t have been so hell bent on getting it perfect. Putting 100% effort into a project with no capital and no income meant a pretty serious hit to my own business.</p>
<p>All in all, not a huge success, not really a medium success either. But over time it&#39;ll make some money and hopefully. There&#39;s also a couple of other business models I can explore, but my biggest problem is I&#39;m not a particularly good business person.</p>
<p>That all said, JS Bin is going no where. I&#39;ve run it as side project for over 6 years, and I&#39;ll continue to run it that way. There&#39;s production grade servers in place, something like 12 million bins in our database and lots of cool stuff still to be done. And the truth is, when it&#39;s fun to work on JS Bin, it&#39;s <em>fun</em>.</p>
<h2>Left Logic</h2>
<p>At the start of the year I took on a new office (actually the same size as what I had before, but I was the sole tenant this time) and I took on two new full time employees <a href="https://twitter.com/allouis_">Fabien O&#39;Carroll</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/electric_g">Giulia Alfonsi</a>, and also <a href="https://twitter.com/dcgauld">David Gauld</a> as a part time/freelancer.</p>
<p><img src="https://remysharp.com/images/leftlogic-team-2014.jpg" alt="Left Logic 2014 team"></p>
<p>But as the year went on, Giulia&#39;s contract ended (at 6 months) and Fabien was tempted away by local Brighton company, Brandwatch (I&#39;m proud to say after he turned them down a few times first).</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a huge pleasure working with Giulia and Fabien - they&#39;re both great people to know and damn good developers. David (equally superb developer) led the <a href="http://leftlogic.com">Left Logic</a> redesign and is continuing to (remotely) contribute to Confwall (a new product from Left Logic).</p>
<p>As 2015 starts, there&#39;s no point in having an office <em>just</em> to myself, so I&#39;m selling all the kit, closing the office and returning to a roaming desk, for all the excitement and concern I have!</p>
<h2>Speaking &amp; Travelling</h2>
<p>Over the last few years I&#39;ve been reducing my public speaking further and further down. This year I only gave two different talks and only three events.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not terribly proud of the talks either, and I feel like they were either duff notes or bombed entirely. Obviously I have a different perspective on things from the stage, but it&#39;s definitely put me off speaking for a while. I realise this is all subjective, but it&#39;s not a great feeling when you put yourself out there only to feel crappy about it.</p>
<p>I did do an epic write up of my <a href="/muddling-my-way-through-real-time">real-time talk on my blog</a>, which I&#39;m pretty proud of.</p>
<p>On the flip side though, I did spend more time attending events just to learn. Oddly, I had quite a few people exclaim &quot;are you speaking?!&quot;. That&#39;s cute, but there&#39;s certain perks to not speaking: like <em>not speaking</em>!</p>
<p>Particular highlights for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://2014.dareconf.com/mini/london">Dareconf mini</a> (London, UK)</li>
<li><a href="https://edgeconf.com/2014-london">Edge London</a> (London, UK)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hybridconf.net/">Hybrid Conf</a> (Stockholm, Sweden)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.smartwebconf.com/">SmartWeb</a> (Bucharest, Romania - where I also spoke)</li>
<li><a href="http://2014.jsconf.eu/">JSConf EU</a> (Berlin, German - more for the people &amp; conversations)</li>
</ul>
<h2>#ffconf, <small>aka Full Frontal</small></h2>
<p>This year, our little event sold in two batches, going in 6 and 3 minutes. Insane.</p>
<p>I was nervous about this year because I had lot a speakers that I really want to hear and I was struggling to find the right balance of what I wanted. There&#39;s also the simple problem that each year has been better than the last, so eventually it has to do worse.</p>
<p>I was wrong to be nervous.</p>
<figure><img class="withcredit" src="https://remysharp.com/images/ffconf-2014.jpg" title="Photo by Drew McLellan"><figcaption class="credit">Photo by Drew McLellan</figcaption></figure>

<p>The event was absolutely amazing and thankfully I wasn&#39;t the only one to think so, <em>everyone</em> I spoke to felt this was the best yet. <a href="http://www.outsidethepage.co.uk/full-frontal-2014/">People</a> <a href="http://www.uvd.co.uk/blog/full-frontal-2014-highlights/">even</a> <a href="http://kyan.com/blog/2014/11/11/full-frontal-2014">blogged</a>!</p>
<p>See for yourself - all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTqrwW2jjXIXuCtFQ-5BIn-s">eight talks from ffconf are available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<p>Although there&#39;s not as many side projects as I&#39;d like this year, it&#39;s clear to me that JS Bin has been consuming my focus for the large part of the year, and that&#39;s <em>okay</em>!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://confwall.com">Confwall</a> - a productised version of the twitter wall I&#39;ve run at ffconf for the last 6 years. Currently open to early beta registrations.</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/53ff41ed8cdf37902b000050">Rest pebble app</a> - a native C app for the Pebble watch that lets me quick set rest timers at the gym.</li>
<li>Blog moved from WordPress (to a Harp/custom node app) and resumed blogging again - something I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time, and I blogged about the process and also all on <a href="https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com">github</a>: <a href="/harp-pt1">part1</a>, <a href="/harp-pt2">part2</a>. I&#39;m most proud of the <a href="/archive/">archive</a> page.</li>
<li>nodemon 1.0 - then pretty much abandoning it for a 11 months and revisiting to add some sweet functionality (look out for 1.3.x in the new year)</li>
<li>Introducing HTML5 - this is <em>still</em> in the works to be published for free. Watch this space!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>In ascending order of personal importance to me:</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Rewiring my blog has encouraged me to blogging again. I&#39;ve long fallen out of love with Twitter and wanted to properly return to blogging. As I said earlier, seeing the full <a href="/archive/">archive</a> of my blog has really encouraged me to write again. I&#39;m pretty proud of the 8 years of content.</p>
<p>This year I was also invited to contribute to the Pastry Box project, where I started posting some very personal thoughts, and I&#39;m proud to be <a href="/tag/personal">hosting them here too</a>. The three particularly important ones being <a href="/time-doesnt-heal">Time doesn&#39;t heal</a>, <a href="/velveteen">My Velveteen Rabbit</a> and <a href="/motivation">Motivation</a></p>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll spare you the pictures this time (though if you want to brave it, <a href="/my-2013#personal">here&#39;s last year</a>)! <strong>Last year I ended my body fat on 19% (down from 30%).</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Fitbit Aria scale, but over the months have lost confidence in their accuracy, so bought a pair of cheap, but more reliable skin callipers.</p>
<p>My body fat at the end of December 2014 (and over the month of December) is <strong>currently 13.8%</strong> (the scales are reading around 10%, which I don&#39;t trust). I also fit into 30 inch jeans and tops that I wore at aged 21 are baggy around my belly (yes, I have a few tops that are over 15 years old!).</p>
<p>My lowest weight (not that I want to be light) was 11 stone. I can see a 6 pack forming (which I&#39;ve <em>never</em> had in all my years).</p>
<p><strong>My biggest deadlift was 170kg</strong>, but I also tore a disc in my lower back trying to do a superset at 140kg (what had previously been a warm up weight). That cost me a month off the gym and 3 months self imposed ban on deadlifts and squats.</p>
<p>Diet is still heavy protein (and I found it quite easy to eat 1500kcals in a day whilst still having 7 meals a day), but I&#39;m trying to add weight at the moment and if I&#39;m honest, I&#39;m struggling!</p>
<p>Oo-oo - and I also got my first few <em>white</em> hairs on my head. Mostly due to <a href="/vatmoss">recent VAT issues</a> but</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: 13.8% is in the <em>Athletes</em> range of body fat. So the future version of me, reading back, should be damn proud.</strong></p>
<h3>Mind &amp; attitudes</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t really know how to set this down as text, but for me, <em>this year</em> in particular, has been a an eye opener in my attitude and thoughts towards gender and race diversity (and yes, there&#39;s more out there, I&#39;m just started).</p>
<p>I found that following more women on twitter (as weird as that sounds, but you know what I mean) has helped broaden my views. I&#39;ve also tried to face and read around topics that I&#39;d normally want to shy away from. It might sound obvious, but if I don&#39;t look and listen then it&#39;s too easy to ignore and pretend all is well.</p>
<p>I always knew that women and people of colour had more to deal with in life, but I didn&#39;t quite want to acknowledge that even though I come from a middle-class family with not very much money, being a white male in Europe with access to computers makes me <em>incredibly</em> privilege. Somehow I thought that the privilege was something to be ashamed of (possibly because I didn&#39;t want people to think that I was rich and spoilt), but the truth is I don&#39;t need to be ashamed, but I do acknowledge this has put me (and many like me) in a position of power for what is effectively a lucky coin toss. I see that now.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve found following people like <a href="https://twitter.com/femfreq">Anita Sarkeesian</a> for the last 6 months a huge eye opener and (<a href="https://remysharp.com/2014/10/27/motivation">though I&#39;ve said before</a>) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkjW9PZBRfk">Emma Watson&#39;s [address to the EU incredibly inspiring</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also <em>trying</em> to read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Gender-Knot-Unraveling-Patriarchal/dp/1439911843/ref=dp_ob_image_bk">The Gender Knot</a>, I&#39;m not far in yet but I hope to take my learnings and pass it on to my children.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> I&#39;m still working this stuff out, and I want to be part of a better system for all.</p>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>My family is the most important thing to me, and I&#39;m so incredibly proud of Julie, my beloved wife and mother to my amazing kids. 2013 saw the arrival of Seren Tuesday Sharp on 17-April 2014 at 9:37am.</p>
<p>It feels like the last 8 months have flown by, and she&#39;s already near-crawling (basically doing army crawls across the floor), is sitting and pulling herself up, and has 3 teeth to her name. And she has these lovely dark eyelashes that (<em>I</em> think) make her blue eyes look dark and beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="/images/seren-2014.jpg" alt="Seren"></p>
<p>Julie and I also celebrated hitting a milestone in our relationship: we&#39;ve now been together for more time in our life than we&#39;ve been apart. 18 years and counting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hugely proud of my family. I&#39;ll always miss Tia and though she&#39;s not in the picture below, she&#39;s always with us.</p>
<p><img src="/images/family-2014.jpg" alt="Sharp family 2014"></p>
<p>(Yes, getting a picture of the whole family is near impossible, getting a picture of us all smiling, <em>is</em> impossible!)</p>
<h2>2015</h2>
<p>Next year is a big change for me from a work perspective. I go back to running solo and though I&#39;m excited, I&#39;m kinda scared too. I&#39;m hoping that I find inspiration in my work again and get to work on some really interesting projects (and if you want to work with me, <a href="http://leftlogic.com/contact">please do get in touch</a>).</p>
<p>Otherwise, happy new year other-people-that-are-not-future-Remy, I hope your 2014 was a good one, and I hope to see you (not you, future-Remy, that&#39;s impossible) in 2015.</p>
