But it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the thing: after getting responses from 800+ developers, I&#39;ve come to realise that most developers, or certainly everyone in this room, everyone watching, everyone reading, see progressive enhancement as a good thing. The &quot;right thing&quot; to do. They understand that it can deliver the web site&#39;s content to a wider audience. There&#39;s no doubt.</p>
<p>There&#39;s accessibility benefits and SEO benefits. SEO, I&#39;ve heard directly from developers, is one way that the business has had buy in to taking a PE approach to development.</p>
<p>But the truth is: progressive enhancement is not part of the workflow.</p>
<h2>What is Progressive Enhancement?</h2><p>Well...it&#39;s a made up term by Steve Champeon who <a href="http://hesketh.com/publications/progressive_enhancement_and_the_future_of_web_design.html">used it to describe the techniques</a> he (or he and team) were using to build web sites instead of taking a graceful degradation approach.</p>
<p>As such, there&#39;s no one single line that defines progressive enhancement. However, Wikipedia defines it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[progressive enhancement] allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection</p>
</blockquote>
<div hidden>while also providing an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth</div>

<p>Graceful degradation works the <em>other way around</em>, in that the complete functionality is delivered to the browser, and edge cases and &quot;older browsers&quot; (not meeting the technical requirements) degrade down to a (potentially) less functionality.</p>
<p><strong>The problem is</strong> based on a survey of my own followers, that&#39;s to say that they&#39;re likely to have similar interests and values when it comes to web dev, 25% of 800 developers still believe that progressive enhancement is simply making the site work without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<h2>How do you make it work without JavaScript?</h2><p>I ran a simple survey of my twitter followers and ask people to share the question too. It asked &quot;what is progressive enhancement?&quot; with 4 limited answers.</p>
<p>Out of <em>800</em> responses, 25% said that progressive enhancement was making the site work <em>without</em> JavaScript.</p>
<p>Which explains the <em>silver bullet response</em> of: &quot;how would a WebRTC chat site work?&quot; ...obviously it wouldn&#39;t.</p>
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QCiXc6QHV4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Which to me, means <strong>delivering a baseline web site that&#39;s usable by the most minimal of requirements</strong>.</p>
<p>Very much what Jeremy Keith has <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/7774">said recently in response</a> to criticism that it&#39;s impossible to progressively enhance everything with today&#39;s expectations. Progressive enhancement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...figuring out what is core functionality and what is an enhancement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So the question becomes</strong> how does the web community re-frame it&#39;s thinking, and looks at progressive enhancement as the baseline that you build upon?</p>
<h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>Today, many developers are writing &quot;thick clients&quot;, that is, JavaScript driving a lot, if not all, of the functionality and presentation in the browser.</p>
<p>The do it by delivering and render <em>views</em> in the browser. The big upside of this is that the site is extremely fast to the user&#39;s input. The other big benefit is that there are a good number of frameworks (Angular, Ember, Polymer to name the &quot;biggies&quot; of today) that lend themselves greatly to client side MVC, i.e. full application logic in the client side code.</p>
<p>The problem is that the frameworks will often (try to) reinvent fundamental building blocks of a web experience. A few simple/classic examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link isn&#39;t a link at all, which means you can&#39;t open it in a new tab, or copy it, or share it...or even click it the way you&#39;d expect to</li>
<li>The <em>button</em> isn&#39;t a button</li>
<li>You can&#39;t share a link to the page you&#39;re looking at (because it&#39;s all client side rendered and doesn&#39;t have a link)</li>
<li>Screen readers can&#39;t navigate the content properly</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn&#39;t mean this isn&#39;t possible, just that it&#39;s more often forgotten. In the same way that Flash was often labelled as inaccessible. This wasn&#39;t true, it was <em>possible</em> to make Flash accessible, it&#39;s just that the default development path didn&#39;t include it.</p>
<p>A more extreme example of this is seen in Flipboard&#39;s mobile site. Importantly: <em>mobile site</em>. Flipboard render the entire page using a <code>canvas</code> element. I can&#39;t speak for the accessibility of the site, but on mobile it performs beautifully. It feels...&quot;native&quot;. And with that, it&#39;s also broken. I can&#39;t copy links, and I can&#39;t copy text - akin to the Flash apps and even Java applet days. It looks great, but it doesn&#39;t feel &quot;of the web&quot;.</p>
<p>The problem is: browsers are shit*.</p>
<ul>
<li>When compared to the proprietary and closed platforms they&#39;re constantly compared to.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s pressure (from SF/Apple/who knows) to deliver web sites that feel &quot;native&quot; (no, I won&#39;t define this) and browsers are always playing catch up with native, proprietary platforms: this is a fact.</p>
<p>Native media elements, native sockets, native audio, native push notifications, native control over network - this all took it&#39;s merry time to get the browser. So when a company decides that the tried and tested approach to styling at list of articles won&#39;t give them the unique UX they want <em>and</em> the 60fps interaction, then of course they&#39;re going to bake up their own technology (in Flipboard&#39;s case, re-inventing wheels with canvas...the <em>exact same way</em> <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/bespin-a-new-mozilla-labs-experimental-extensible-code-editor-using-canvas">Bespin</a> did back in it&#39;s day).</p>
<h2>But...how would a thick-client work without JavaScript?</h2><p>Angular, for instance, does not have a developer story for how to develop a site with progressive enhancement as a baseline.</p>
<p>Does this mean it&#39;s not possible? I don&#39;t think so. Without the stories though, developers will gravitate towards solved problems (understandably).</p>
<p><strong>What does this story look like when a framework is a prerequisite of the project?</strong></p>
<h2>Web Components</h2><p>Web Components are a hot debate topic. They could cause all kinds of mess of the web. On the other hand, they&#39;re also a perfect fit for progressive enhancement.</p>
<p>Take the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;creditcard&quot; required autocomplete=&quot;cc-number&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that I&#39;m not using the <code>pattern</code> attribute because it&#39;s hard to match correctly to credit cards (they might have spaces between groups of numbers, or dashes, or not at all).</p>
<p>There&#39;s also no validation, and the first number also tells us what kind of card is being used (4 indicates a Visa card for instance).</p>
<p>A web component could progressively enhance the element similarly to the way the browser would natively enhance <code>type=&quot;date&quot;</code> for instance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;stripe-cc-card&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;creditcard&quot; required autocomplete=&quot;cc-number&quot;&gt;
&lt;/stripe-cc-card&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder, <strong>are web components the future of progressive enhancement?</strong></p>
<h2>Potential problems on the horizon</h2><p>Developers are inherently lazy. It&#39;s what makes them/us optimise our workflows and become very good at solving problems. We re-use what&#39;s known to work and tend to eke out the complex parts that we can &quot;live without&quot;. Sadly, this can be at the cost of accessibility and progressive enhancement.</p>
<p>I think there&#39;s some bigger potential problems on the horizon: ES6 - esnext (i.e. the future of JavaScript).</p>
<h3>&quot;But progressive enhancement has nothing to do with ES-whatever...&quot;</h3><p>Taking a step back for a moment. Say we&#39;re writing an HTML only web site (no CSS or JS). But we want to use the latest most amazing <em>native</em> email validation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; required&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Simple. But...what happens <em>if</em> <code>type=&quot;email&quot;</code> isn&#39;t supported? Well, nothing bad. The element will be a text element (and we can validate on the server). <em>The HTML doesn&#39;t break</em>.</p>
<p>JavaScript isn&#39;t quite the same, but we can code defensively, using feature detection and polyfills where appropriate.</p>
<p>ES6 has features that breaks this design. Syntax breaking features that cannot exist alongside our ES5 and cannot be polyfilled. It must be transpiled.</p>
<h3>Syntax breaking</h3><p>There&#39;s a small number of ES6 features that are syntax breaking, the &quot;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a>&quot; in particular.</p>
<p>This means, if the arrow function is encountered by a browser that doesn&#39;t support ES6 arrows, it&#39;s cause a syntax error. If the site is following best practise and combining all their JavaScript into a single file, this means that <em>all</em> their JavaScript just broke (I&#39;ve personally seen this on JS Bin when we used <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/blob/b1e56287d668818b361bc71b299fc36b707f9e6e/views/index.html#L311-L320">jshint which uses ES5 setters and broke IE8</a>).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve asked people on the TC39 group and JavaScript experts as to what the right approach here is (bear in mind this is still early days).</p>
<p>The answer was a mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use feature detection (including for syntax breaking features) and conditionally load the <em>right</em> script, either the ES5 or ES6</li>
<li>Transpile your ES6 to ES5 and make both available</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems brittle and the more complexity the more likely that as time goes by, new projects will leave out the transpile part, and forget about supporting older browsers - or even newer browsers that don&#39;t ship with ES6 support (perhaps because the VM footprint is smaller and has to work in a super low powered environment).</p>
<p>Since JavaScript doesn&#39;t exhibit the same resilience that HTML &amp; CSS does, so the fear is that it&#39;ll leave users who can&#39;t upgrade, faced with a broken or blank page.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a workflow that solves this? Or are we forced to support two incompatible languages on the web?</strong></p>
