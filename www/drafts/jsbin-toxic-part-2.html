<p>This is a story about JS Bin. I&#39;ve told one story of JS Bin before, and this is the b-side: the dark side. But remember with everything I share with you, JS Bin is the longest running live pastebin, and it&#39;s not going anywhere. It will continue to run and serve its users. Even the scumbags.</p>
<p>The story has been broken into 5 parts, released over a series of days.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-1">Part 1: The start of the DDoS</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-2">Part 2: Spam</a></li>
<li>Part 3: Registered users wreaking havoc</li>
<li>Part 4: The cost</li>
<li>Part 5: Police</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 2: Spam</h2>
<p>Who doesn&#39;t love a filthy dose of spam with their product? Let&#39;s picture exactly what JS Bin is: a place that people can <em>anonymously</em> create public web pages.</p>
<p>So...yeah...I guess I should have known I was asking for trouble.</p>
<p>JS Bin, as of April 2015, has well over 15,000,000 bins. It crossed 10 million bins late last year, so that number has been accelerating. It should. That&#39;s what growth is about. But I had to face it, there&#39;s no way there&#39;s 5 million new bins with everyone learning the magic of the web stack. There&#39;s going to be some spam in there.</p>

<h3>Affiliate spam</h3>
<p>No, not spam that I, or JS Bin are affiliated with! At some point in 2014, I searched Google with &quot;site:jsbin.com&quot; just to see what awesome content existed. Sadly, Google&#39;s only reply, and pages of reply, was this &quot;affiliate spam&quot;.</p>
<p>Bear with me: it&#39;s a page that contains a tonne of links that usually entices the reader to click through for some kind of random product. Maybe a DVD or a CD containing the secrets to earning your first million or some such nonsense.</p>
<p>In some cases, since I have admin access to JS Bin, I would just delete the bin. But it was (and is) like playing whack-a-mole. You delete one, and immediately find another - partly also because with JS Bin, you&#39;re deleting a revision, and not the whole collection of bins (I&#39;ve yet to develop that).</p>
<p>So in this case, I would head to the database and run dangerous manual queries to delete all the bins with the offending URL. Thankfully, in the 15 million rows, I had the good sense to add an index early on to the URL field, so it&#39;s quick and doesn&#39;t lock up the table.</p>
<h3>SEO spam</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t really understand what this is, but it&#39;s definitely a thing. Similar to the affiliate junk, SEO spam would just contain an insane amount of links to web sites. I still don&#39;t understand it, but it&#39;s definitely nefarious.</p>
<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>Yay, phishing. Phishing is actually the very first type of abuse I ever came across on JS Bin. I don&#39;t remember who reported it to me, but at some point, someone was trying to phish the Habbo.com homepage.</p>
<p>It&#39;s why, even today, the <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/blob/config.default.json"><em>public</em> config</a> for JS Bin contains a default blacklist for <code>habbo.com</code> and <code>processform.cgi</code>. The blacklist prevents the bin from being saved. Everything works, but it just silently fails to save.</p>
<p>In production the blacklisting is much much larger these days, and includes frankly stupid stuff like <code>kardishain</code>, <code>Clickbank</code> and snippets of nasty code like <code>...|63|0A|27|73|70|2E|2F|...</code> which aims to prevent code that&#39;s used in some kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>But yeah: whack-a-mole.</p>
<h3>Link hiding</h3>
<p>The last type of spam that appeared in JS Bin is using JS Bin as a link sharing site to the dark and shitty side of the web. Arsehats (the nasty users, as I like to call them) would use JS Bin to redirect using <code>top.location=&quot;http://arsehat.com&quot;</code>. Then, using the full output URL, it would be shared on networks like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Since &quot;arsehat.com&quot; was already blocked on Facebook and Twitter, but JS Bin wasn&#39;t, it&#39;s an efficient way to share links to bad places, and hide under JS Bin.</p>
<p>It&#39;s kinda depressing that when I search Twitter for &quot;jsbin.com&quot;, it would mostly yield weirdos sharing things like webcams to their toilet fetish funsies.</p>
<h3>If you can&#39;t play nice...</h3>
<p>In August 2014, I made the hard decision that I would have to reduce JS Bin&#39;s functionality if it was going to continue to positively contribute to the web, instead of flooding it sludge filled spam.</p>
<p>I limited the full output <em>for anonymous bins</em> to last 90 minutes, then it would automatically revert to the edit view. Since the edit view is compiled using JavaScript, it had no use to SEO indexing. The live output <code>iframe</code> is also protected with a <code>sandbox</code> attribute that prevents location redirects, so the link hiding issue also (mostly) went away.</p>
<p>Finally, all output views (i.e. the full output without the &quot;JS Bin editor&quot; bit) include the <code>X-Robots-Tag: nofollow</code> header - which is the new way of doing <code>robots.txt</code>. This seems to have helped stamp out the &quot;SEO&quot; use of JS Bin.</p>
<p>But it didn&#39;t end there...</p>

<p>Return for part 3: how the registered users, who I thought were the goodies, wreaked havoc.</p>
