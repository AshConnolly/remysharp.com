<p>This is a story about JS Bin. I&#39;ve told one story of JS Bin before, and this is the b-side: the dark side. But remember with everything I share with you, JS Bin is the longest running live pastebin, and it&#39;s not going anywhere. It will continue to run and serve its users. Even the scumbags.</p>
<p>The story has been broken into 5 parts, released over a series of days.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-1">Part 1: The start of the DDoS</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-2">Part 2: Spam</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-3">Part 3: Registered users wreaking havoc</a></li>
<li>Part 4: The cost</li>
<li>Part 5: Police</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 3: Registered users wreaking havoc</h2>
<p>Originally JS Bin was 100% anonymous. I liked that. But after about a year (or so...I forget), there was clearly an important feature missing: people couldn&#39;t recall their old bins.</p>
<p>Duh. Obviously. It&#39;s <em>anonymous</em>. But that didn&#39;t really fly for an answer. Before the full version 3 rewrite (from PHP to Node), I implemented a simple system that you could &quot;register&quot; your name and &quot;key&quot; as your token. This meant that advanced users would know how to recall their bins (so long as this special cookie was in place).</p>
<p>When I realised I had implemented user sign-in in quite possibly the crapest way, version 3, new, clean, slick JS Bin, came with proper sign-in, register and password reminder.</p>
<p>With one fatal flaw: there were zero checks on your account. No email authentication, no captcha (I hate crapchas), no nothing. And registered users didn&#39;t have <em>any</em> limitations on their bins - the public output would remain public.</p>
<p>This, unknowingly to me, lead to an increase in registrations. Yay! No. Not yay. These were not the kinds of folk you wanted in your system. What&#39;s worse, is these users would create multiple accounts to create multiple bins, all of which were not limited. They&#39;d still be limited by the blacklisting, but blacklisting is simple and probably doesn&#39;t even catch 20% of the junk.</p>
<h3>Grinding to a total halt</h3>
<p>On the morning of March 26th, 2015, I was solo parenting looking after my awesome little ones, when I started noticing reports on JS Bin that something might be very wrong.</p>
<p><img src="/images/seren-family.jpg" alt="The Sharps"></p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned that the bins went from 10 million to 15 million in around 6 months (or so). Our registration rate was also climbing insanely quickly. The net effect of this: storing more content.</p>
<p>Storage is cheap, right? Sure is. JS Bin stores it&#39;s database on a 100GB drive. It&#39;s <em>just text</em> for heavens sake.</p>
<p>JS Bin&#39;s database ran out of disk space. All of it. Gone. So much so, that I <em>couldn&#39;t delete data</em>. (I think) because MySQL needs to create a tmp file to run queries, that since there was literally no disk space, it couldn&#39;t create the tmp file to delete the junk bins that were seemingly coming in faster and faster.</p>
<p>The weird thing was that JS Bin still worked. It could recall bins and you could use JS Bin, you <em>just couldn&#39;t save</em> (though, that&#39;s kind of a problem...).</p>
<p>When you&#39;re solo parenting, though, there&#39;s no support around and there was no way I was going to (or even <em>could</em>) abondon the kids to work on solving this issue. I had to suck it up, and trying to focus entirely on the kids and ignore the problem until my wife returned home. I did manage to put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/rem/status/581004721785167872">cry</a> for <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/2320">help</a> which had lots of lovely support, but support doesn&#39;t fix fucked disks.</p>
<p>Though, eventually, a few hours later, I managed to swap in a 400GB disk to the AWS database. This solved the issue right away, but the source of the problem was still wide open.</p>
<h3>If you (still) can&#39;t play nice...</h3>
<p>Wide open registrations was always a stupid idea. An entirely anonymous web site, given JS Bin&#39;s purpose, is also a stupid idea.</p>
<p>In the end the <em>only</em> way to register with JS Bin <em>now</em> is via GitHub. I don&#39;t like this, but it does lean on GitHub&#39;s verification process. It doesn&#39;t kill the issue 100%, but it reduced our sign-up rate significantly and we only have the odd one arsehat come through (which I also then report back to GitHub).</p>
<hr>
<p>In part 4, I&#39;ll talk about the costs of running JS Bin, and how pro failed to save the day.</p>
