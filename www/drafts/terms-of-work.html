<p>Nothing in this document will prevent us from having an excellent working relationship, and I&#39;ve worked with many clients over the years where these terms were in place, but unspoken. This document simply puts it all in writing.</p>
<h2>Working week</h2><p>The working week is Tuesday to Friday. The reasons are purely personal and this is non negotiable.</p>
<h2>Billing</h2><p>You will be billed by the hour, and hours are tracked using time logging tools (currently Toggl), which will be giving in summary in the invoice.</p>
<p>For longer term engagements, invoices will be sent on the first working day of the start of the month. Otherwise the invoice will be sent at the end of the work. Invoices will be due 30 days after receipt.</p>
<p>All costs are exclusive of VAT @ 20% for EU based companies.</p>
<h3>Expenses</h3><p>I try to be sensible when it comes to expenses. Whilst I&#39;m working remotely, it&#39;s extremely unlikely that there will be any expenses.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m required to visit your offices any travel and hotel costs will be added to expenses and included in the following invoice. Unless your company books their own hotels, I will find a reasonably priced (usually economy) hotel nearby for the duration required.</p>
<p>Food, if required will also be included in the expenses. Alcoholic drinks will not be included in any expenses.</p>
<p>If a flight is required, I will fly economy for European bound flights and economy plus for longer flights. Again, I will book these myself to find the best price for the dates required.</p>
<p>If you require sign off on any of these expenses, please say so in advance.</p>
<h2>Hours</h2><p>Working hours will run from 9-5 with a soft start and soft end, ie. it&#39;s not uncommon for me to continue to work on a problem until 6:30pm if appropriate.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll allocate an hour for lunch, but have the discretion to choose to work through this time. </p>
<p>All hours are tracked for invoicing purposes.</p>
<p>I do not work weekends unless very special situations arise. Non working hours (outside of my working days) will be charged at time and a half during the week, and double time at the weekend. Out of hours time is blocked billed in 1/4 days.</p>
<p>I will respond to messages and emails outside of the working hours at my own discretion. If a message is urgent, please indicate so - but please be aware there may be some billing applied. If significant time is required, I will try to confirm you are happy to proceeded first (if nature of the situation allows).</p>
<h2>Holidays and away days</h2><p>Longer breaks from work (three days and upwards) will be notified a month in advance and every effort will be made to make this accommodate with your work.</p>
<p>If a holiday break is known before the contract is being agreed, this will be shared ahead of time.</p>
<p>As hoc time off (for doctor appointments for instance) may be required, and any lost hours will be made up.</p>
<h2>Tweeting, blogging and public speaking</h2><p>My twitter account and blog are my personal and professional face on the internet. I won&#39;t post anything that I shouldn&#39;t about the work so long as this is outlined up front.</p>
<p>Obviously I will apply my own discretion and professionalism.</p>
<p>I will not be asked to promote your product or company.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2><p>Any exceptions to these terms will be documented and agreed in writing.</p><p class="update">Drafts may be incomplete or entirely abandonded, so please forgive me.
