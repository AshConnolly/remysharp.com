I&#39;ve told one story of JS Bin before, and this is the b-side: the dark side. But remember with everything I share with you, JS Bin is the longest running live pastebin, and it&#39;s not going anywhere. It will continue to run and serve its users. Even the scumbags.</p>
<p>The story has been broken into 5 parts, released over a series of days.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-1">Part 1: The start of the DDoS</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-2">Part 2: Spam</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-3">Part 3: Registered users wreaking havoc</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-4">Part 4: The cost</a></li>
<li><a href="/jsbin-toxic-part-5">Part 5: Police</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 5: Police</h2><p>I said before that JS Bin Pro really sucked the love out of the project for me, but this part has been a mix of emotions, but it&#39;s definitely the most distressed I&#39;ve been when running JS Bin...</p>
<p>Over the years I&#39;ve had cease and desist emails telling me that I&#39;ve either been hacked or stolen content. I would take my time (through gritted teeth) explaining that JS Bin allowed users to upload their own content, and that this wasn&#39;t something I was trying to do to hurt the company or institution.</p>
<p>Nearly every single time, the content would be removed promptly (usually at the same time as I was responding to explain what JS Bin was), but there&#39;s three occasions that stand out in my memory.</p>
<h3>Evening calls</h3><p>Early 2010, I was doing a lot of client work and when the phone rang at 7pm, I asked Julie (my wife and business partner) to shoo them away and to say that I was unavailable.</p>
<p>I think I was actually having a moment on The Throne when Julie gave a knock on the door. &quot;You need to take this, it&#39;s the Police&quot;.</p>
<p>No one really wants the Police phoning their house.</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t actually as painful as I would have guessed. The man said he was calling from the London Met. Police, and that he was dealing with a coordinated DDoS attack orchestrated over Facebook due to take place tomorrow evening.</p>
<p>The messages (on Facebook) were using JS Bin as the method of attack (yes, pretty much script kiddies), and to the police officer&#39;s credit, he had done his research on JS Bin and understood that <em>I hadn&#39;t created these bins</em>. He was calling to ask if I could <em>possibly</em> take the links down (yes, we&#39;re <a href="https://twitter.com/soverybritish">So Very British</a>).</p>
<p>Absolutely. Minutes later, the bins were gone. I didn&#39;t hear back again, but it would be the first in a dozen or so (gentle) encounters with the police.</p>
<h3>The worst email I ever received</h3><p>One late evening in 2013, sat on the sofa watching a film, I get an email. As with all webby people that don&#39;t understand that work is supposed to stop at 6pm, I go ahead and get my laptop and read the email.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an email from the Spanish police. Sort of a cease and desist, including two links to JS Bin asking for their immediate take down. I can&#39;t actually find the original email because I wanted to erase all memory of the event.</p>
<p>There had been issues in the past where porn had been linked to from JS Bin and it&#39;s constant battle to keep it under control. The email from the Spanish police however, did not warn me as to what was behind the URLs.</p>
<p>I clicked, and my memory is slow motion of what I saw next, and thankfully the internet was also slow to load.</p>
<hr>
<p>Just enough loaded for me to realise that the images contained child pornography, early enough for me <em>not</em> to see anything that would scar me for life. I closed the window very quickly.</p>
<p>It still makes me sick to think that <em>that</em> kind of content was being hosted on one of my URLs.</p>
<p>Using the terminal, I <code>cURL</code>ed the URL down to look for any commonalities between the source of the two JS Bin URLs I had, to immediately add it to the blacklist functionality. Thankfully...if there was a thing, I did find a commonality, and I was able to block what appeared to be a source for this kind of material.</p>
<p>It took many days to to get that sickening feeling out of my system. I hate to think that JS Bin has helped abusers in some way.</p>
<h3>&quot;Terrorist use&quot;</h3><p>I&#39;ve used inverted quotes around &quot;terrorist use&quot;, because, well they&#39;re not my words, and I&#39;m not 100% certain that JS Bin falls squarely into be used for terrorism. But, it&#39;s certainly a new area for my project.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, an issue was filed, claiming exactly this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/jsbin-terrorism.png" alt="Terrorism attacks"></p>
<p>The bin that&#39;s referred to was being used to attack the Madison Police web site, apparently organised by Anonymous:</p>
<p><img src="/images/jsbin-anonymous-attack.jpg" alt="Anonymous attacks"></p>
<p>I took down the bin, and added appropriate blacklisting, but also noticed that the issue was filed about 10 <em>days</em> after the attack had taken place!</p>
<h3>It&#39;s part of the job...</h3><p>I&#39;d like to end this section with some parting advice on how JS Bin is better now, but sadly it&#39;s part of the job when you build a site that houses all the crap the internet has to offer. The easier JS Bin makes it so that content can be saved, the more it&#39;ll be used in new ways that causes some kind of trouble.</p>
<p>Obviously the flip side is that JS Bin is open to all, and that includes kids wanting to learn, educators, newbies, &quot;hackers&quot; and more.</p>
<p>But, it would be great, as author of jsfiddle said, if Anonymous could write and use their own pastebin!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zalun/status/602586249203945472"><img src="/images/jsbin-please-write.png" alt="Please, Anonymous, write your own"></a></p>
<h2>Finding the love, again</h2><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this post (and the public talk version of this) for about a year now. I was hesitant because it was so negative and probably comes across a little bitter.</p>
<p>The irony however, is that it&#39;s been a cathartic process. I feel like I&#39;ve got some of the poison out of me by going through this process.</p>
<p>I realised something important at the end of 2014, and it was the reason I decided to put development on JS Bin on hold: I need to love working on JS Bin. I didn&#39;t at the time. I was working on parts of JS Bin that was full of pressure, I started getting abuse for some of my work, and it was all a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>Since starting this post, I&#39;ve released new features to JS Bin to all groups of users (anonymous, registered and pro) and have several JS Bin <a href="http://jsbin.com/blog">blog posts</a> in the works.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started to find my love for my project again.</p>
