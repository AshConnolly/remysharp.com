<p>Back in April 2012 I joined the bandwagon and backed the hyped kickerstarter campaign for the very first Pebble.</p>
<p>After waiting way way too long and abandoning my original choice for an orange watch I was forced to choose the black, only to get my hands on it earlier.</p>
<p>I also hadn&#39;t worn a watch in well over 15 years. I&#39;m not 100% what prompted me to buy the watch. Perhaps the promise of an open source platform...?</p>
<p>When it <em>fin-nal-ly</em> arrived, what I noticed immediately was that it was massive on my wrist. The strap was particularly large and never really felt snug.</p>
<p><strong>I figured it wouldn&#39;t even last 3 months on my wrist.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>What was the point of the Pebble?</h2>
<p>The Pebble gave me one important (to me) feature. Text messages (and calls) would vibrate on my wrist.</p>
<p>I&#39;d found that when I was away from home, I&#39;d nearly always miss text messages from my wife. Even when my phone was on vibrate and loud, I&#39;d still miss them.</p>
<p>A small vibration on my wrist would <em>subtlety</em> alert me to something I could decide to action or not. For me, this was a big deal and an important feature.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the first 3 months it was a novelty. I kept reading about cool apps that could do text responses - but alas I was using an iPhone and none of this functionality was available to my phone.</p>
<p>The first turning point to my unimpressed state was spending 1 month trailing a move to Android. This experience totally opened up the Pebble&#39;s functionality to me. But that was <em>just</em> a trial, and I would move back to the (limiting) iPhone.</p>
<p>So, why and how am I still wearing my Pebble today?</p>
<h2>My Pebble today</h2>
<p>Some 2 years later I still wear my Pebble. Every day. It helps that I finally ditched my iPhone for an Android (a OnePlus One - and that&#39;s another blog post).</p>
<p>The strap has broken, it needs charging once a week (insane if you compare to a regular watch) and the bottom right action button (1 out of 4 buttons) is playing up.</p>
<p>One strange thing that kept happening, particularly strange if you consider how conservative the British are: random people would ask my &quot;how am I finding my watch?&quot;. A guy on a plane, someone in the gym changing rooms, it was all very strange (to me).</p>
<p>But with all these issues, the clunkiness and being forced to converse with other human beings: <em>why</em> am I still wearing it??!</p>
<p>I customised it. I made it mine. It&#39;s <em>my</em> watch, and there&#39;s no other watch like it.</p>
<h2>Open source: learning &amp; modifying other people&#39;s&nbsp;code</h2>
<p>I&#39;d tried in the past to make my own watch face but failed pretty hard. But then my second attempt took an existing <a href="https://github.com/edwinfinch/simplyclean">watch face</a> and made <a href="https://github.com/remy/simplyclean/">my own</a> modifications, including using a custom font.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a memory leak in the original code that causes the watch face to crash every now and then, and I&#39;ll likely get around to debugging and fixing it...one day.</p>
<p><small>A tiny note: since I forked the project, the license on Simply Clean has changed/been removed. It doesn&#39;t affect my code, but I thought it was fair to point out.</small></p>
<p>I used <a href="https://cloudpebble.net">CloudPebble</a> for all of the development I&#39;ve done so far on the Pebble, and it&#39;s an absolutely superb resource.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pebble-og.jpg" alt="My OG Pebble"></p>
<h2>I know JavaScript!</h2>
<p>Although there&#39;s a couple of limitations in the JS apps, the simple fact is: I can create my ideas as JavaScript based Pebble apps in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>I recently wrote a <a href="https://github.com/remy/pebble-brighton-buses">quick interface</a> to a <a href="http://buses.leftlogic.com">local bus time webapp</a> that I wrote. Now from my wrist, in a few presses I have the bus times on my wrist.</p>
<p>From a practical use, this is actually easier than using my phone because it takes a few seconds to do the geo-lookup and then request the content from the bus website, so when I&#39;m rushing around in the morning, I don&#39;t have to mess around with my phone.</p>
<p>I also wrote a simple prototype with a Spark that I could control LEDs from my watch. Pointless, but cool (<a href="https://instagram.com/p/sDFL0aqavo/">see this short video demo</a>).</p>
<p>There is, however, a small cost to pay with JavaScript apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>They <em>only</em> work whilst you have a connection from your watch to your phone (since the actual JS is executed on the phone)</li>
<li>There&#39;s a laggy response time on the button presses, particularly (I&#39;ve noticed) going backwards through the app (or unloading)</li>
<li>Firing up the JS based Pebble app can interfere with apps running on the phone - I noticed that it would stop my OnePlus One&#39;s camera from recording video as I launch the JS app (which is where there&#39;s no video yet)</li>
</ul>
<h3>I (kinda) know C too...</h3>
<p>The <em>actual reason</em> the button is failing on my Pebble is because I use it so much: I wrote a C based app that I use in the gym to time my rest time between sets. I called it (cleverly...) <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/53ff41ed8cdf37902b000050">Rest</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pebble-rest.jpg" alt="Rest app"></p>
<p>Its simple. No animations, no nonsense. Three pre-set (configurable) times in seconds, and a timer. I&#39;m in the gym 4 times a week, and usually have around 20-25 sets. I use my app between <em>every</em> set. My app is <strong>exactly</strong> what I need for the task I perform multiple times a day.</p>
<h2>How it affects my daily routine</h2>
<p>As with the Rest app being part of my daily routing, the alarms are also an important part of my routing. I have alarms set throughout the day to remind me exactly when I need to eat. Silly as it sounds, making the watch integral to my daily routine is what&#39;s given me a reason to keep it charged and keep it on.</p>
<p>Being able to customise it, using my knowledge of code and knowing how to hack through other people&#39;s code has lulled me into loving this small piece of tech.</p>
<p><strong>Being able to express myself in my pebble is what&#39;s made me love it.</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve also realised that I always prefered the look of services like de.licio.us (circa 2005) over Magnolia, and in a way, the Pebble is when compared to the other smart watches out there.</p>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of my friends have asked me &quot;when are you getting the iWatch&quot;, to which I say I&#39;m not interested (<em>seriously</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rem">follow me on twitter</a> if you need an idea of how <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Arem%20apple&amp;src=typd">sick I am of Apple</a>) - and in fact, I <em>also</em> backed the new Pebble Time project and I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on that device and play some more.</p>
<h2>Next: Time</h2>
<p>Akin with simplicity of the Pebble, my Pebble Time arrived in this simple cardboard, no-frills packaging, and I&#39;m keen to see how I can customise this watch and make it mine, again.</p>
