<p>To &quot;correctly&quot; apply the right amount of VAT in light of recent EU VAT changes you now only need to capture one piece of proof to support your VAT selection.</p>
<p>Your options are &quot;simple&quot;, that is, assuming you&#39;re an Internet Service Provider. In reality even for a tech savvy company like myself, the &quot;Five Presumptions for choosing location of residency&quot; are <a href="http://www.vatlive.com/eu-vat-rules/2015-digital-services-moss/location-of-customer-moss-2015/">frankly a joke</a>. The include things like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the services are provided through mobile networks, the customer is presumed to reside in the same country as that of the SIM card code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how exactly is the web site supposed to get the SIM card code? Sure...</p>
<h2>The backup</h2>
<p>The official alternative if you&#39;re not an ISP with insane access to things like whether &quot;services are provided through a fixed landline&quot; or not, is to capture <strong>2 non-conflicting pieces of location data</strong>, then a 3rd piece in case the first two are in conflict.</p>
<p>However, I believe this to be futile. The first issue is if the first 2 pieces of location data are in conflict, there&#39;s a decent chance that the 3rd piece will also be in conflict, and how you&#39;ve got a bunch of data none of which actually tells you anything.</p>
<p>More importantly, I believe <strong>if you have the bank location, you shouldn&#39;t need anything else</strong>.</p>
<h2>The ultimate source of truth</h2>
<p>Some businesses won&#39;t be able to get the card holder bank origin before actually applying the correct VAT. In this case, then you have to make the assumption based on the &quot;non-conflicting data&quot;.</p>
<p>However, if you&#39;re using a system like Stripe (as I am), then you get full details about the card data <strong>before</strong> you finalise the transaction cost.</p>
<p>If the bank that holds the card is based Spain (for instance) then the individual who opened the account must provide proof of citizenship or if it was opened by a business, then the business must legally operate in that country.</p>
<p>Both of these facts require that the individual or business pay taxes in Spain, and <strong>therefore if the card says it&#39;s registered in Spain, there&#39;s no other option that to charge them Spanish VAT rates</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore: if you have the card country origin, you <strong>don&#39;t need anything else</strong>.</p>
<h2>Example case study</h2>
<p>Say Jane is British, working and living in Italy for Air Italy (the airline) as a developer and she needs a subscription to my product.</p>
<p>My product is going to get for 3 pieces of information on purchase of my product:</p>
<ol>
<li>The billing address of the debit or credit card used</li>
<li>Her IP address run against a geoip lookup database (ie. to best guess her location)</li>
<li>The telephone landline number (using the country code from the phone number)</li>
</ol>
<p>As the address the web site asks for, she puts her home address (due to bad web site copy), her company uses proxies for web traffic and the landline number is +39...</p>
<p>The result is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The address resolves to the UK</li>
<li>IP address resolves to Switerland</li>
<li>The phone number resolves to Italy</li>
</ol>
<p>However, as she pays she has <em>two</em> options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use her personal bank card</li>
<li>Use the business bank card</li>
</ol>
<p>If she uses her personal bank card, the country location is UK, and the money she has in her UK bank account is taxed under UK tax law.</p>
<p>If she uses her business bard card, then country location it Italy, and the money (in that bank account) is correctly taxed under Italian tax law.</p>
<p>Making the initial 3 pieces of information utterly redundant, and the card country origin the ultimate source of truth.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&#39;ve no idea how, but I&#39;d love to see this proposed to the HMRC and HM Treasury groups that are discussing these problems behind closed doors.</p>
