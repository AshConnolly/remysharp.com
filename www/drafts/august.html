<p>August had come early for me. I was struggling by mid July. I felt sad a lot of the time, and like I was on a tightrope where if my focus shifted off at all, everything would come crumbling around me.</p>
<p>I also hadn&#39;t visited Tia&#39;s graveside in nearly two months - which we normally do monthly and it helps to release some of the tension.</p>
<p>In the end, last week, I was able to take an afternoon to myself. I visited her grave and when I returned home, read through a diary I kept following the days of her birth and death.</p>
<p>After Tia was born, I needed to write. So I wrote a full account of what happened. Blow by blow. I&#39;ve only re-read it a handful of times in the last 5 years. </p>
<p>When I did, I cried, hard. The kind of crying that hurts. Like I was squeezing the pain out of my body. The kind of crying that, even that evening, hours later, my face was still worn out. </p>
<p>It helped me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I find it hard to tell people that she was stillborn. I feel like it does her a disservice. That she&#39;s somehow <em>less</em> important. My wife carried Tia to full term. Tia came through natural child birth, and she was still alive the day before - we know because we were in hospital being monitored.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart over and over to think of the time that she was still alive. All I know now is that she&#39;s lost. Whenever I think of, or see photos of my wife heavily pregnant, I yearn for a way to change the inevitable outcome. </p>
<p>She is our daughter. She&#39;s our first baby. My wife <em>did</em> delivery her. She made no sound coming into the world, and this broke me completely.</p>
<p>The small mercy is that we were able to spend one day with her. To hold her. Lay with her, together, as our family.</p>
<p>It hurts so, so badly that I don&#39;t know what colour her eyes are. Still. To this day. 5 years on.</p>
<p>But this is not my darkest memory. The worst thing I&#39;ve done in my life I cannot change.</p>
<p>After we spent that one single, most precious day with her, we had to leave. I had to leave my poor baby. Alone. Words don&#39;t do this justice, but this is the hardest and worst thing I&#39;ve ever had to do in my life, and I will take that pain to my grave.</p>
